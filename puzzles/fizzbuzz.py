Here are the rules for the FizzBuzz problem:

Given the length of the output of numbers from 1 - n:
If a number is divisible by 3, append "Fizz" to a list.
If a number is divisible by 5, append "Buzz" to that same list.
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, append "FizzBuzz" to the list.
If a number meets none of theese rules, just append the string of the number.

>>> fizz_buzz(15)
['1', '2', 'Fizz', '4', 'Buzz', 'Fizz', '7', '8', 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz']


REMEMBER: Use Encapsulation! D.R.Y.
>>> joined_buzz(15)
'1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz'
