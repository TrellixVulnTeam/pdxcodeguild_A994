BUTCHER, M.A.\\n\\nAND\\n\\nA. LANG, M.A.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE.\\n\\nThere would have been less controversy about the proper\\nmethod of Homeric translation, if critics had recognised\\nthat the question is a purely relative one, that of Homer\\nthere can be no final translation. The taste and the\\nliterary habits of each age demand different qualities in\\npoetry, and therefore a different sort of rendering of\\nHomer. To the men of the time of Elizabeth, Homer would\\nhave appeared bald, it seems, and lacking in ingenuity, if\\nhe had been presented in his antique simplicity. For the\\nElizabethan age, Chapman supplied what was then necessary,\\nand the mannerisms that were then deemed of the essence of\\npoetry, namely, daring and luxurious conceits. Thus in\\nChapman\\'s verse Troy must \\'shed her towers for tears of\\noverthrow,\\' and when the winds toss Odysseus about, their\\nsport must be called \\'the horrid tennis.\\'\\n\\nIn the age of Anne, \\'dignity\\' and \\'correctness\\' had to be\\ngiven to Homer, and Pope gave them by aid of his dazzling\\nrhetoric, his antitheses, his _netteté_, his command of every\\nconventional and favourite artifice. Without Chapman\\'s\\nconceits, Homer\\'s poems would hardly have been what the\\nElizabethans took for poetry; without Pope\\'s smoothness,\\nand Pope\\'s points, the Iliad and Odyssey would have seemed\\nrude, and harsh in the age of Anne. These great\\ntranslations must always live as English poems. As\\ntranscripts of Homer they are like pictures drawn from a\\nlost point of view. Chaque siecle depuis le xvi a ue de ce\\ncote son belveder different. Again, when Europe woke to a\\nsense, an almost exaggerated and certainly uncritical\\nsense, of the value of her songs of the people, of all the\\nballads that Herder, Scott, Lonnrot, and the rest\\ncollected, it was commonly said that Homer was a\\nballad-minstrel, that the translator must imitate the\\nsimplicity, and even adopt the formulae of the ballad.\\nHence came the renderings of Maginn, the experiments of Mr.\\nGladstone, and others. There was some excuse for the error\\nof critics who asked for a Homer in ballad rhyme. The Epic\\npoet, the poet of gods and heroes, did indeed inherit some\\nof the formulae of the earlier Volks-lied. Homer, like the\\nauthor of The Song of Roland, like the singers of the\\nKalevala, uses constantly recurring epithets, and repeats,\\nword for word, certain emphatic passages, messages, and so\\non. That custom is essential in the ballad, it is an\\naccident not the essence of the epic. The epic is a poem of\\ncomplete and elaborate art, but it still bears some\\nbirthmarks, some signs of the early popular chant, out of\\nwhich it sprung, as the garden-rose springs from the wild\\nstock, When this is recognised the demand for ballad-like\\nsimplicity and \\'ballad-slang\\' ceases to exist, and then all\\nHomeric translations in the ballad manner cease to\\nrepresent our conception of Homer. After the belief in the\\nballad manner follows the recognition of the romantic vein\\nin Homer, and, as a result, came Mr. Worsley\\'s admirable\\nOdyssey. This masterly translation does all that can be\\ndone for the Odyssey in the romantic style. The smoothness\\nof the verse, the wonderful closeness to the original,\\nreproduce all of Homer, in music and in meaning, that can\\nbe rendered in English verse. There still, however, seems\\nan aspect Homeric poems, and a demand in connection with\\nHomer to be recognised, and to be satisfied.\\n\\nSainte-Beuve says, with reference probably to M. Leconte de\\nLisle\\'s prose version of the epics, that some people treat\\nthe epics too much as if the were sagas. Now the Homeric\\nepics are sagas, but then they are the sagas of the divine\\nheroic age of Greece, and thus are told with an art which\\nis not the art of the Northern poets. The epics are stories\\nabout the adventures of men living in most respects like\\nthe men of our own race who dwelt in Iceland, Norway,\\nDenmark, and Sweden. The epics are, in a way, and as far as\\nmanners and institutions are concerned, historical\\ndocuments. Whoever regards them in this way, must wish to\\nread them exactly as they have reached us, without modern\\nornament, with nothing added or omitted. He must recognise,\\nwith Mr. Matthew Arnold, that what he now wants, namely,\\nthe simple truth about the matter of the poem, can only be\\ngiven in prose, \\'for in a verse translation no original\\nwork is any longer recognisable.\\' It is for this reason\\nthat we have attempted to tell once more, in simple prose,\\nthe story of Odysseus. We have tried to transfer, not all\\nthe truth about the poem, but the historical truth, into\\nEnglish. In this process Homer must lose at least half his\\ncharm, his bright and equable speed, the musical current of\\nthat narrative, which, like the river of Egypt, flows from\\nan indiscoverable source, and mirrors the temples and the\\npalaces of unforgotten gods and kings. Without this music\\nof verse, only a half truth about Homer can be told, but\\nthen it is that half of the truth which, at this moment, it\\nseems most necessary to tell. This is the half of the truth\\nthat the translators who use verse cannot easily tell. They\\nMUST be adding to Homer, talking with Pope about \\'tracing\\nthe mazy lev\\'ret o\\'er the lawn,\\' or with Mr. Worsley about\\nthe islands that are \\'stars of the blue Aegaean,\\' or with\\nDr. Hawtrey about \\'the earth\\'s soft arms,\\' when Homer says\\nnothing at all about the \\'mazy lev\\'ret,\\' or the \\'stars of\\nthe blue Aegaean,\\' or the \\'soft arms\\' of earth. It would be\\nimpertinent indeed to blame any of these translations in\\ntheir place. They give that which the romantic reader of\\npoetry, or the student of the age of Anne, looks for in\\nverse; and without tags of this sort, a translation of\\nHomer in verse cannot well be made to hold together.\\n\\nThere can be then, it appears, no final English translation\\nof Homer. In each there must be, in addition to what is\\nGreek and eternal, the element of what is modern, personal,\\nand fleeting. Thus we trust that there may be room for \\'the\\npale and far-off shadow of a prose translation,\\' of which\\nthe aim is limited and humble. A prose translation cannot\\ngive the movement and the fire of a successful translation\\nin verse; it only gathers, as it were, the crumbs which\\nfall from the richer table, only tells the story, without\\nthe song. Yet to a prose translation is permitted, perhaps,\\nthat close adherence to the archaisms of the epic, which in\\nverse become mere oddities. The double epithets, the\\nrecurring epithets of Homer, if rendered into verse, delay\\nand puzzle the reader, as the Greek does not delay or\\npuzzle him. In prose he may endure them, or even care to\\nstudy them as the survivals of a stage of taste, which is\\nto be found in its prime in the sagas. These double and\\nrecurring epithets of Homer are a softer form of the quaint\\nNorthern periphrases, which make the sea the \\'swan\\'s bath,\\'\\ngold, the \\'dragon\\'s hoard,\\' men, the \\'ring-givers,\\' and so\\non. We do not know whether it is necessary to defend our\\nchoice of a somewhat antiquated prose. Homer has no ideas\\nwhich cannot be expressed in words that are \\'old and\\nplain,\\' and to words that are old and plain, and, as a\\nrule, to such terms as, being used by the Translators of\\nthe Bible, are still not unfamiliar, we have tried to\\nrestrict ourselves. It may be objected, that the employment\\nof language which does not come spontaneously to the lips,\\nis an affectation out of place in a version of the Odyssey.\\nTo this we may answer that the Greek Epic dialect, like the\\nEnglish of our Bible, was a thing of slow growth and\\ncomposite nature, that it was never a spoken language, nor,\\nexcept for certain poetical purposes, a written language.\\nThus the Biblical English seems as nearly analogous to the\\nEpic Greek, as anything that our tongue has to offer.\\n\\nThe few foot-notes in this book are chiefly intended to\\nmake clear some passages where there is a choice of\\nreading. The notes at the end, which we would like to have\\nwritten in the form of essays, and in company with more\\ncomplete philological and archaeological studies, are\\nchiefly meant to elucidate the life of Homer\\'s men. We have\\nreceived much help from many friends, and especially from\\nMr. R. W. Raper, Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford and Mr.\\nGerald Balfour, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who\\nhas aided us with many suggestions while the book was\\npassing through the press.\\n\\nIn the interpretation of B. i.411, ii.191, v.90, and 471,\\nwe have departed from the received view, and followed Mr.\\nRaper, who, however, has not been able to read through the\\nproof-sheets further than Book xii.\\n\\nWe have adopted La Roche\\'s text (Homeri Odyssea, J. La\\nRoche, Leipzig, 1867), except in a few cases where we\\nmention our reading in a foot-note.\\n\\nThe Arguments prefixed to the Books are taken, with very\\nslight alterations, from Hobbes\\' Translation of the\\nOdyssey.\\n\\nIt is hoped that the Introduction added to the second\\nedition may illustrate the growth of those national legends\\non which Homer worked, and may elucidate the plot of the\\nOdyssey.\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.\\n\\nWet owe our thanks to the Rev. E. Warre, of Eton College,\\nfor certain corrections on nautical points. In particular,\\nhe has convinced us that the raft of Odysseus in B. v. is a\\nraft strictly so called, and that it is not, under the\\npoet\\'s description, elaborated into a ship, as has been\\ncommonly supposed. The translation of the passage (B.\\nv.246-261) is accordingly altered.\\n\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nCOMPOSITION AND PLOT OF THE ODYSSEY.\\n\\nThe Odyssey is generally supposed to be somewhat the later\\nin date of the two most ancient Greek poems which are\\nconcerned with the events and consequences of the Trojan\\nwar. As to the actual history of that war, it may be said\\nthat nothing is known. We may conjecture that some contest\\nbetween peoples of more or less kindred stocks, who\\noccupied the isles and the eastern and western shores of\\nthe Aegean, left a strong impression on the popular fancy.\\nRound the memories of this contest would gather many older\\nlegends, myths, and stories, not peculiarly Greek or even\\n\\'Aryan,\\' which previously floated unattached, or were\\nconnected with heroes whose fame was swallowed up by that\\nof a newer generation. It would be the work of minstrels,\\npriests, and poets, as the national spirit grew conscious\\nof itself, to shape all these materials into a definite\\nbody of tradition. This is the rule of development--first\\nscattered stories, then the union of these into a NATIONAL\\nlegend. The growth of later national legends, which we are\\nable to trace, historically, has generally come about in\\nthis fashion. To take the best known example, we are able\\nto compare the real history of Charlemagne with the old\\nepic poems on his life and exploits. In these poems we find\\nthat facts are strangely exaggerated, and distorted; that\\npurely fanciful additions are made to the true records,\\nthat the more striking events of earlier history are\\ncrowded into the legend of Charles, that mere fairy tales,\\ncurrent among African as well as European peoples, are\\ntransmuted into false history, and that the anonymous\\ncharacters of fairy tales are converted into historical\\npersonages. We can also watch the process by which feigned\\ngenealogies were constructed, which connected the princely\\nhouses of France with the imaginary heroes of the epics.\\nThe conclusion is that the poetical history of Charlemagne\\nhas only the faintest relations to the true history. And we\\nare justified in supposing that, quite as little of the\\nreal history of events can be extracted from the tale of\\nTroy, as from the Chansons de Geste.\\n\\nBy the time the Odyssey was composed, it is certain that a\\npoet had before him a well-arranged mass of legends and\\ntraditions from which he might select his materials. The\\nauthor of the Iliad has an extremely full and curiously\\nconsistent knowledge of the local traditions of Greece, the\\nmemories which were cherished by Thebans, Pylians, people\\nof Mycenae, of Argos, and so on. The Iliad and the Odyssey\\nassume this knowledge in the hearers of the poems, and take\\nfor granted some acquaintance with other legends, as with\\nthe story of the Argonautic Expedition. Now that story\\nitself is a tissue of popular tales,--still current in many\\ndistant lands,--but all woven by the Greek genius into the\\nhistory of Iason.\\n\\nThe history of the return of Odysseus as told in the\\nOdyssey, is in the same way, a tissue of old marchen.\\nThese must have existed for an unknown length of time\\nbefore they gravitated into the cycle of the tale of Troy.\\n\\nThe extraordinary artistic skill with which legends and\\nmyths, originally unconnected with each other, are woven\\ninto the plot of the Odyssey, so that the marvels of savage\\nand barbaric fancy become indispensable parts of an\\nartistic whole, is one of the chief proofs of the unity of\\nauthorship of that poem. We now go on to sketch the plot,\\nwhich is a marvel of construction.\\n\\nOdysseus was the King of Ithaca, a small and rugged island\\non the western coast of Greece. When he was but lately\\nmarried to Penelope, and while his only son Telemachus was\\nstill an infant, the Trojan war began. It is scarcely\\nnecessary to say that the object of this war, as conceived\\nof by the poets, was to win back Helen, the wife of\\nMenelaus, from Paris, the son of Priam, King of Troy. As\\nMenelaus was the brother of Agamemnon, the Emperor, so to\\nspeak, or recognised chief of the petty kingdoms of\\n\\'Greece, the whole force of these kingdoms was at his\\ndisposal. No prince came to the leaguer of Troy from a home\\nmore remote than that of Odysseus. When Troy was taken, in\\nthe tenth year of the war, his homeward voyage was the\\nlongest and most perilous.\\n\\nThe action of the Odyssey occupies but the last six weeks\\nof the ten years during which Odysseus was wandering. Two\\nnights in these six weeks are taken up, however, by his own\\nnarrative of his adventures (to the Phaeacians, p. xx) in\\nthe previous ten years. With this explanatory narrative we\\nmust begin, before coming to the regular action of the\\npoem.\\n\\nAfter the fall of Troy, Odysseus touched at Ismarus, the\\ncity of a Thracian people, whom he attacked and plundered,\\nbut by whom he was at last repulsed. The north wind then\\ncarried his ships to Malea, the extreme southern point of\\nGreece. Had he doubled Malea safely, he would probably have\\nreached Ithaca in a few days, would have found Penelope\\nunvexed by wooers, and Telemachus a boy of ten years old.\\nBut this was not to be.\\n\\nThe \\'ruinous winds\\' drove Odysseus and his ships for ten\\ndays, and on the tenth they touched the land of the Lotus-\\nEaters, whose flowery food causes sweet forgetfulness.\\nLotus-land was possibly in Western Libya, but it is more\\nprobable that ten days\\' voyage from the southern point of\\nGreece, brought Odysseus into an unexplored region of\\nfairy-land. Egypt, of which Homer had some knowledge, was\\nbut five days\\' sail from Crete.\\n\\nLotus-land, therefore, being ten days\\' sail from Malea, was\\nwell over the limit of the discovered world. From this\\ncountry Odysseus went on till he reached the land of the\\nlawless Cyclopes, a pastoral people of giants. Later Greece\\nfeigned that the Cyclopes dwelt near Mount Etna, in Sicily.\\nHomer leaves their place of abode in the vague.  Among the\\nCyclopes, Odysseus had the adventure on which his whole\\nfortunes hinged. He destroyed the eye of the cannibal\\ngiant, Polyphemus, a son of Poseidon, the God of the Sea.\\nTo avenge this act, Poseidon drove Odysseus wandering for\\nten long years, and only suffered him to land in Ithaca,\\n\\'alone, in evil case, to find troubles in his house.\\' This\\nis a very remarkable point in the plot. The story of the\\ncrafty adventurer and the blinding of the giant, with the\\npunning device by which the hero escaped, exists in the\\nshape of a detached marchen or fairy-tale among races who\\nnever heard of Homer. And when we find the story among\\nOghuzians, Esthonians, Basques, and Celts, it seems natural\\nto suppose that these people did not break a fragment out\\nof the Odyssey, but that the author of the Odyssey took\\npossession of a legend out of the great traditional store\\nof fiction. From the wide distribution of the tale, there\\nis reason to suppose that it is older than Homer, and that\\nit was not originally told of Odysseus, but was attached to\\nhis legend, as floating jests of unknown authorship are\\nattributed to eminent wits. It has been remarked with truth\\nthat in this episode Odysseus acts out of character, that\\nhe is foolhardy as well as cunning. Yet the author of the\\nOdyssey, so far from merely dove-tailing this story at\\nrandom into his narrative, has made his whole plot turn on\\nthe injury to the Cyclops. Had he not foolishly exposed\\nhimself and his companions, by his visit to the Cyclops,\\nOdysseus would never have been driven wandering for ten\\nweary years. The prayers of the blinded Cyclops were heard\\nand fulfilled by Poseidon.\\n\\nFrom the land of the Cyclops, Odysseus and his company\\nsailed to the Isle of Aeolus, the king of the winds. This\\nplace too is undefined; we only learn that, even with the\\nmost favourable gale, it was ten days\\' sail from Ithaca. In\\nthe Isle of Aeolus Odysseus abode for a month, and then\\nreceived from the king a bag in which all the winds were\\nbound, except that which was to waft the hero to his home.\\nThis sort of bag was probably not unfamiliar to\\nsuperstitious Greek sailors who had dealings with witches,\\nlike the modern wise women of the Lapps. The companions of\\nthe hero opened the bag when Ithaca was in sight, the winds\\nrushed out, the ships were borne back to the Aeolian Isle,\\nand thence the hero was roughly dismissed by Aeolus. Seven\\ndays\\' sail brought him to Lamos, a city of the cannibal\\nLaestrygonians. Their country, too, is in No-man\\'s-land,\\nand nothing can be inferred from the fact that their\\nfountain was called Artacia, and that there was an Artacia\\nin Cyzicus. In Lamos a very important adventure befel\\nOdysseus. The cannibals destroyed all his fleet, save one\\nship, with which he made his escape to the Isle of Circe.\\nHere the enchantress turned part of the crew into swine,\\nbut Odysseus, by aid of the god Hermes, redeemed them, and\\nbecame the lover of Circe. This adventure, like the story\\nof the Cyclops, is a fairy tale of great antiquity. Dr.\\nGerland, in his Alt Griechische Marchen in der Odyssee, his\\nshown that the story makes part of the collection of\\nSomadeva, a store of Indian tales, of which 1200 A.D. is\\nthe approximate date. Circe appears as a Yackshini, and is\\nconquered when an adventurer seizes her flute whose magic\\nmusic turns men into beasts. The Indian Circe had the habit\\nof eating the animals into which she transformed men.\\n\\nWe must suppose that the affairs with the Cicones, the\\nLotus-eaters, the Cyclops, Aeolus, and the Laestrygonians,\\noccupied most of the first year after the fall of Troy. A\\nyear was then spent in the Isle of Circe, after which the\\nsailors were eager to make for home. Circe commanded them\\nto go down to Hades, to learn the homeward way from the\\nghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias. The descent into\\nhell, for some similar purpose, is common in the epics of\\nother races, such as the Finns, and the South-Sea\\nIslanders. The narrative of Odysseus\\'s visit to the dead\\n(book xi) is one of the most moving passages in the whole\\npoem.\\n\\nFrom Teiresias Odysseus learned that, if he would bring his\\ncompanions home, he must avoid injuring the sacred cattle\\nof the Sun, which pastured in the Isle of Thrinacia.  If\\nthese were harmed, he would arrive in Ithaca alone, or in\\nthe words of the Cyclops\\'s prayer, I in evil plight, with\\nloss of all his company, on board the ship of strangers, to\\nfind sorrow in his house.\\' On returning to the Isle Aeaean,\\nOdysseus was warned by Circe of the dangers he would\\nencounter. He and his friends set forth, escaped the Sirens\\n(a sort of mermaidens), evaded the Clashing Rocks, which\\nclose on ships (a fable known to the Aztecs), passed Scylla\\n(the pieuvre of antiquity) with loss of some of the\\ncompany, and reached Thrinacia, the Isle of the Sun. Here\\nthe company of Odysseus, constrained by hunger, devoured\\nthe sacred kine of the Sun, for which offence they were\\npunished by a shipwreck, when all were lost save Odysseus.\\nHe floated ten days on a raft, and then reached the isle of\\nthe goddess Calypso, who kept him as her lover for eight\\nyears.\\n\\nThe first two years after the fall of Troy are now\\naccounted for. They were occupied, as we have seen, by\\nadventures with the Cicones, the Lotus-eaters, the Cyclops,\\nAeolus, the Laestrygonians, by a year\\'s residence with\\nCirce, by the descent into Hades, the encounters with the\\nSirens, and Scylla, and the fatal sojourn in the isle of\\nThrinacia. We leave Odysseus alone, for eight years,\\nconsuming his own heart, in the island paradise of Calypso.\\n\\nIn Ithaca, the hero\\'s home, things seem to have passed\\nsmoothly till about the sixth year after the fall of Troy.\\nThen the men of the younger generation, the island chiefs,\\nbegan to woo Penelope, and to vex her son Telemachus.\\nLaertes, the father of Odysseus, was too old to help, and\\nPenelope only gained time by her famous device of weaving\\nand unweaving the web. The wooers began to put compulsion\\non the Queen, quartering themselves upon her, devouring her\\nsubstance, and insulting her by their relations with her\\nhandmaids. Thus Penelope pined at home, amidst her wasting\\npossessions. Telemachus fretted in vain, and Odysseus was\\ndevoured by grief and home-sickness in the isle of Calypso.\\nWhen he had lain there for nigh eight years, the action of\\nthe Odyssey begins, and occupies about six weeks.\\n\\n  DAY 1 (Book i).\\n\\nThe ordained time has now arrived, when by the counsels of\\nthe Gods, Odysseus is to be brought home to free his house,\\nto avenge himself on the wooers, and recover his kingdom.\\nThe chief agent in his restoration is Pallas Athene; the\\nfirst book opens with her prayer to Zeus that Odysseus may\\nbe delivered. For this purpose Hermes is to be sent to\\nCalypso to bid her release Odysseus, while Pallas Athene in\\nthe shape of Mentor, a friend of Odysseus, visits\\nTelemachus in Ithaca. She bids him call an assembly of the\\npeople, dismiss the wooers to their homes, and his mother\\nto her father\\'s house, and go in quest of his own father,\\nin Pylos, the city of Nestor, and Sparta, the home of\\nMenelaus. Telemachus recognises the Goddess, and the first\\nday closes.\\n\\n  DAY 2 (Book ii).\\n\\nTelemachus assembles the people, but he has not the heart\\nto carry out Athene\\'s advice. He cannot send the wooers\\naway, nor turn his mother out of her house. He rather\\nweakly appeals to the wooers\\' consciences, and announces\\nhis intention of going to seek his father. They answer with\\nscorn, but are warned of their fate, which is even at the\\ndoors, by Halitherses. His prophecy (first made when\\nOdysseus set out for Troy) tallies with the prophecy of\\nTeiresias, and the prayer of the Cyclops. The reader will\\nobserve a series of portents, prophecies, and omens, which\\ngrow more numerous and admonishing as their doom draws\\nnearer to the wooers. Their hearts, however, are hardened,\\nand they mock at Telemachus, who, after an interview with\\nAthene, borrows a ship and secretly sets out for Pylos.\\nAthene accompanies him, and his friends man his galley.\\n\\n  DAY 3 (Book iii).\\n\\nThey reach Pylos, and are kindly received by the aged\\nNestor, who has no news about Odysseus. After sacrifice,\\nAthene disappears.\\n\\n  DAY 4 (Book iii).\\n\\nThe fourth day is occupied with sacrifice, and the talk of\\nNestor. In the evening Telemachus (leaving his ship and\\nfriends at Pylos) drives his chariot into Pherae, half way\\nto Sparta; Peisistratus, the soil of Nestor, accompanies\\nhim.\\n\\n  DAY 5 (Book iv).\\n\\nTelemachus and Peisistratus arrive at Sparta, where\\nMenelaus and Helen receive them kindly.\\n\\n  DAY 6 (Book iv).\\n\\nMenelaus tells how he himself came home in the eighth year\\nafter the fall of Troy. He had heard from Proteus, the Old\\nMan of the Sea, that Odysseus was alive, and a captive on\\nan island of the deep. Menelaus invites Telemachus to Stay\\nwith him for eleven days or twelve, which Telemachus\\ndeclines to do. It will later appear that he made an even\\nlonger stay at Sparta, though whether he changed his mind,\\nor whether we have here an inadvertence of the poet\\'s it is\\nhard to determine. This blemish has been used as an\\nargument against the unity of authorship, but writers of\\nall ages have made graver mistakes.\\n\\nOn this same day (the sixth) the wooers in Ithaca learned\\nthat Telemachus had really set out to I cruise after his\\nfather.\\' They sent some of their number to lie in ambush\\nfor him, in a certain strait which he was likely to pass on\\nhis return to Ithaca. Penelope also heard of her son\\'s\\ndeparture, but was consoled by a dream.\\n\\n  DAY 7 (Book v).\\n\\nThe seventh day finds us again in Olympus. Athene again\\nurges the release of Odysseus; and Hermes is sent to bid\\nCalypso let the hero go. Zeus prophecies that after twenty\\ndays sailing, Odysseus will reach Scheria, and the\\nhospitable Phaeacians, a people akin to the Gods, who will\\nconvey him to Ithaca. Hermes accomplishes the message to\\nCalypso.\\n\\n  DAYS 8-12-32 (Book v).\\n\\nThese days are occupied by Odysseus in making and launching\\na raft; on the twelfth day from the beginning of the action\\nhe leaves Calypso\\'s isle. He sails for eighteen days, and\\non the eighteenth day of his voyage (the twenty-ninth from\\nthe beginning of the action), he sees Scheria. Poseidon\\nraises a storm against him, and it is not till the\\nthirty-second day from that in which Athene visited\\nTelemachus, that he lands in Scheria, the country of the\\nPhaeacians. Here he is again in fairy land. A rough, but\\nperfectly recognisable form of the Phaeacian myth, is found\\nin an Indian collection of marchen (already referred to) of\\nthe twelfth century A.D. Here the Phaeacians are the\\nVidyidhiris, and their old enemies the Cyclopes, are the\\nRakshashas, a sort of giants. The Indian Odysseus, who\\nseeks the city of gold, passes by the home of an Indian\\nAeolus, Satyavrata. His later adventures are confused, and\\nthe Greek version retains only the more graceful fancies of\\nthe marchen.\\n\\n  DAY 33 (Book vi).\\n\\nOdysseus meets Nausicaa, daughter of Alcinous, the\\nPhaeacian King, and by her aid, and that of Athene, is\\nfavourably received at the palace, and tells how he came\\nfrom Calypso\\'s island. His name is still unknown to his\\nhosts.\\n\\n  DAY 34 (Books vii, viii, ix, x, xi, xii).\\n\\nThe Phaeacians and Odysseus display their skill in sports.\\nNausicaa bids Odysseus farewell. Odysseus recounts to\\nAlcinous, and Arete, the Queen, those adventures in the two\\nyears between the fall of Troy and his captivity in the\\nisland of Calypso, which we have already described (pp.\\nxiii-xvii).\\n\\n  DAY 35 (Book xiii).\\n\\nOdysseus is conveyed to Ithaca, in the evening, on one of\\nthe magical barques of the Phaeacians.\\n\\n  DAY 36 (Books xiii, xiv, xv).\\n\\nHe wakens in Ithaca, which he does not at first recognise\\nHe learns from Athene, for the first time, that the wooers\\nbeset his house. She disguises him as an old man, and bids\\nhim go to the hut of the swineherd Eumaeus, who is loyal to\\nhis absent lord. Athene then goes to Lacedaemon, to bring\\nback Telemachus, who has now resided there for a month.\\nOdysseus won the heart of Eumaeus, who of course did not\\nrecognise him, and slept in the swineherd\\'s hut, while\\nAthene was waking Telemachus, in Lacedaemon, and bidding\\nhim \\'be mindful of his return.\\'\\n\\n  DAY 37 (Book xv).\\n\\nIs spent by Odysseus in the swineherd\\'s hut. Telemachus\\nreaches Pherae, half-way to Pylos.\\n\\n\\n  DAY 38 (Book xv).\\n\\nTelemachus reaches Pylos, but does not visit Nestor. To\\nsave time he goes at once on board ship, taking with him an\\nunfortunate outlaw, Theoclymenus, a second-sighted man, or\\nthe family of Melampus, in which the gift of prophecy was\\nhereditary. The ship passed the Elian coast at night, and\\nevaded the ambush of the wooers. Meanwhile Odysseus was\\nsitting up almost till dawn, listening to the history of\\nEumaeus, the swineherd.\\n\\n  DAY 39 (Books xv, xvi).\\n\\nTelemachus reaches the Isle of Ithaca, sends his ship to\\nthe city, but himself, by advice of Athene, makes for the\\nhut of Eumaeus, where he meets, but naturally does not\\nrecognise, his disguised father. He sends Eumaeus to\\nPenelope with news of his arrival, and then Athene reveals\\nOdysseus to Telemachus. The two plot the death of the\\nwooers. Odysseus bids Telemachus remove, on a favourable\\nopportunity, the arms which were disposed as trophies on\\nthe walls of the hall at home. (There is a slight\\ndiscrepancy between the words of this advice and the manner\\nin which it is afterwards executed.) During this interview,\\nthe ship of Telemachus, the wooers who had been in ambush,\\nand Eumaeus, all reached the town of Ithaca. In the evening\\nEumaeus returned to his hut, where Athene had again\\ndisguised Odysseus.\\n\\n  DAY 40 (Books xvii, xviii, xix, xx).\\n\\nThe story is now hastening to its close, and many events\\nare crowded into the fortieth day. Telemachus goes from the\\nswineherd\\'s hut to the city, and calls his guest,\\nTheoclymenus, to the palace. The second-sighted man\\nprophesies of the near revenge of Odysseus. In the\\nafternoon, Odysseus (still disguised) and Eumaeus reach the\\ncity, the dog Argos recognises the hero, and dies. Odysseus\\ngoes begging through his own hall, and is struck by\\nAntinous, the proudest of the wooers. Late in the day\\nEumaeus goes home, and Odysseus fights with the braggart\\nbeggar Irus. Still later, Penelope appears among the\\nwooers, and receives presents from them. When the wooers\\nhave withdrawn, Odysseus and Telemachus remove the weapons\\nfrom the hall to the armoury. Afterwards Odysseus has an\\ninterview with Penelope (who does not recognise him), but\\nhe is recognised by his old nurse Eurycleia. Penelope\\nmentions her purpose to wed the man who on the following\\nday, the feast of the Archer-god Apollo, shall draw the bow\\nof Odysseus, and send an arrow through the holes in twelve\\naxe-blades, set up in a row. Thus the poet shows that\\nOdysseus has arrived in Ithaca not a day too soon. Odysseus\\nis comforted by a vision of Athene, and\\n\\n  DAY 41 (Books xx, xxi, xxii, xxiii).\\n\\nby the ominous prayer uttered by a weary woman grinding at\\nthe mill. The swineherd and the disloyal Melanthius arrive\\nat the palace. The wooers defer the plot to kill\\nTelemachus, as the day is holy to Apollo. Odysseus is led\\nup from his seat near the door to a place beside Telemachus\\nat the chief\\'s table. The wooers mock Telemachus, and the\\nsecond-sighted Theoclymenus sees the ominous shroud of\\ndeath covering their bodies, and the walls dripping with\\nblood. He leaves the doomed company. In the trial of the\\nbow, none of the wooers can draw it; meanwhile Odysseus has\\ndeclared himself to the neatherd and the swineherd. The\\nformer bars and fastens the outer gates of the court, the\\nlatter bids Eurycleia bar the doors of the womens\\' chambers\\nwhich lead out of the hall. Odysseus now gets the bow into\\nhis hands, strings it, sends the arrow through the\\naxe-blades, and then leaping on the threshold of stone,\\ndeals his shafts among the wooers. Telemachus, the\\nneatherd, and Eumaeus, aiding him, he slaughters all the\\ncrew, despite the treachery of Melanthius. The paramours of\\nthe wooers are hanged, and Odysseus, after some delay, is\\nrecognised by Penelope.\\n\\n  DAY 42 (Books xxiii, xxiv).\\n\\nThis day is occupied with the recognition of Odysseus by\\nhis aged father Laertes, and with the futile attempt of the\\nkinsfolk of the wooers to avenge them on Odysseus. Athene\\nreconciles the feud, and the toils of Odysseus are\\naccomplished.\\n\\nThe reader has now before him a chronologically arranged\\nsketch of the action of the Odyssey. It is, perhaps,\\napparent, even from this bare outline, that the composition\\nis elaborate and artistic, that the threads of the plot are\\nskilfully separated and combined. The germ of the whole\\nepic is probably the popular tale, known all over the\\nworld, of the warrior who, on his return from a long\\nexpedition, has great difficulty in making his prudent wife\\nrecognise him. The incident occurs as a detached story in\\nChina, and in most European countries it is told of a\\ncrusader. \\'We may suppose it to be older than the legend of\\nTroy, and to have gravitated into the cycle of that legend.\\nThe years of the hero\\'s absence are then filled up with\\nadventures (the Cyclops, Circe, the Phaeacians, the Sirens,\\nthe descent into hell) which exist as scattered tales, or\\nare woven into the more elaborate epics of Gaels, Aztecs,\\nHindoos, Tartars, South-Sea Islanders, Finns, Russians,\\nScandinavians, and Eskimo. The whole is surrounded with the\\natmosphere of the kingly age of Greece, and the result is\\nthe Odyssey, with that unity of plot and variety of\\ncharacter which must have been given by one masterly\\nconstructive genius. The date at which the poet of the\\nOdyssey lived may be approximately determined by his\\nconsistent descriptions of a peculiar and definite\\ncondition of society, which had ceased to exist in the\\nninth century B.C., and of a stage of art in which\\nPhoenician and Assyrian influences predominated. (Die Kunst\\nbei Homer. Brunn.) As to the mode of composition, it would\\nnot be difficult to show that at least the a priori Wolfian\\narguments against the early use of writing for literary\\npurposes have no longer the cogency which they were once\\nthought to possess. But this is matter for a separate\\ninvestigation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Odyssey\\n\\n\\n\\nBook I\\n\\n  In a Council of the Gods, Poseidon absent, Pallas procureth\\n  an order for the restitution of Odysseus; and appearing to\\n  his son Telemachus, in human shape, adviseth him to\\n  complain of the Wooers before the Council of the people,\\n  and then go to Pylos and Sparta to inquire about his\\n  father.\\n\\nTell me, Muse, of that man, so ready at need, who wandered\\nfar and wide, after he had sacked the sacred citadel of\\nTroy, and many were the men whose towns he saw and whose\\nmind he learnt, yea, and many the woes he suffered in his\\nheart upon the deep, striving to win his own life and the\\nreturn of his company.  Nay, but even so he saved not his\\ncompany, though he desired it sore. For through the\\nblindness of their own hearts they perished, fools, who\\ndevoured the oxen of Helios Hyperion: but the god took from\\nthem their day of returning. Of these things, goddess,\\ndaughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,\\ndeclare thou even unto us.\\n\\nNow all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction,\\nwere at home, and had escaped both war and sea, but\\nOdysseus only, craving for his wife and for his homeward\\npath, the lady nymph Calypso held, that fair goddess, in\\nher hollow caves, longing to have him for her lord. But\\nwhen now the year had come in the courses of the seasons,\\nwherein the gods had ordained that he should return home to\\nIthaca, not even there was he quit of labours, not even\\namong his own; but all the gods had pity on him save\\nPoseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus,\\ntill he came to his own country. Howbeit Poseidon had now\\ndeparted for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that\\nare sundered in twain, the uttermost of men, abiding some\\nwhere Hyperion sinks and some where he rises.  There he\\nlooked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams, there he\\nmade merry sitting at the feast, but the other gods were\\ngathered in the halls of Olympian Zeus. Then among them the\\nfather of gods and men began to speak, for he bethought him\\nin his heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of Agamemnon,\\nfar-famed Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out\\namong the Immortals:\\n\\n\\'Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For\\nof us they say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves,\\nthrough the blindness of their own hearts, have sorrows\\nbeyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus,\\nbeyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife\\nof the son of Atreus, and killed her lord on his return,\\nand that with sheer doom before his eyes, since we had\\nwarned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the\\nslayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor\\nwoo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the\\nhand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man\\'s estate\\nand long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he\\nprevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good\\nwill; but now hath he paid one price for all.\\'\\n\\nAnd the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: \\'O\\nfather, our father Cronides, throned in the highest; that\\nman assuredly lies in a death that is his due; so perish\\nlikewise all who work such deeds! But my heart is rent for\\nwise Odysseus, that hapless one, who far from his friends\\nthis long while suffereth affliction in a seagirt isle,\\nwhere is the navel of the sea, a woodland isle, and therein\\na goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the wizard\\nAtlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself\\nupholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder.\\nHis daughter it is that holds the hapless man in sorrow:\\nand ever with soft and guileful tales she is wooing him to\\nforgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning to see if it\\nwere but the smoke leap upwards from his own land, hath a\\ndesire to die. As for thee, thine heart regardeth it not at\\nall, Olympian! What! did not Odysseus by the ships of the\\nArgives make thee free offering of sacrifice in the wide\\nTrojan land? Wherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O\\nZeus?\\'\\n\\nAnd Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered her, and said, \\'My\\nchild, what word hath escaped the door of thy lips? Yea,\\nhow should I forget divine Odysseus, who in understanding\\nis beyond mortals and beyond all men hath done sacrifice to\\nthe deathless gods, who keep the wide heaven? Nay, but it\\nis Poseidon, the girdler of the earth, that hath been wroth\\ncontinually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops\\' sake\\nwhom he blinded of his eye, even godlike Polyphemus whose\\npower is mightiest amongst all the Cyclopes. His mother was\\nthe nymph Thoosa, daughter of Phorcys, lord of the\\nunharvested sea, and in the hollow caves she lay with\\nPoseidon. From that day forth Poseidon the earth-shaker\\ndoth not indeed slay Odysseus, but driveth him wandering\\nfrom his own country. But come, let us here one and all\\ntake good counsel as touching his returning, that he may be\\ngot home; so shall Poseidon let go his displeasure, for he\\nwill in no wise be able to strive alone against all, in\\ndespite of all the deathless gods.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, and said:\\n\\'O father, our father Cronides, throned in the highest, if\\nindeed this thing is now well pleasing to the blessed gods,\\nthat wise Odysseus should return to his own home, let us\\nthen speed Hermes the Messenger, the slayer of Argos, to\\nthe island of Ogygia. There with all speed let him declare\\nto the lady of the braided tresses our unerring counsel,\\neven the return of the patient Odysseus, that so he may\\ncome to his home. But as for me I will go to Ithaca that I\\nmay rouse his son yet the more, planting might in his\\nheart, to call an assembly of the long-haired Achaeans and\\nspeak out to all the wooers who slaughter continually the\\nsheep of his thronging flocks, and his kine with trailing\\nfeet and shambling gait. And I will guide him to Sparta and\\nto sandy Pylos to seek tidings of his dear father\\'s return,\\nif peradventure he may hear thereof and that so he may be\\nhad in good report among men.\\'\\n\\nShe spake and bound beneath her feet her lovely golden\\nsandals that wax not old, and bare her alike over the wet\\nsea and over the limitless land, swift as the breath of the\\nwind. And she seized her doughty spear, shod with sharp\\nbronze, weighty and huge and strong, wherewith she quells\\nthe ranks of heroes with whomsoever she is wroth, the\\ndaughter of the mighty sire. Then from the heights of\\nOlympus she came glancing down, and she stood in the land\\nof Ithaca, at the entry of the gate of Odysseus, on the\\nthreshold of the courtyard, holding in her hand the spear\\nof bronze, in the semblance of a stranger, Mentes the\\ncaptain of the Taphians. And there she found the lordly\\nwooers: now they were taking their pleasure at draughts in\\nfront of the doors, sitting on hides of oxen, which\\nthemselves had slain. And of the henchmen and the ready\\nsquires, some were mixing for them wine and water in bowls,\\nand some again were washing the tables with porous sponges\\nand were setting them forth, and others were carving flesh\\nin plenty.\\n\\nAnd godlike Telemachus was far the first to descry her, for\\nhe was sitting with a heavy heart among the wooers dreaming\\non his good father, if haply he might come somewhence, and\\nmake a scattering of the wooers there throughout the\\npalace, and himself get honour and bear rule among his own\\npossessions. Thinking thereupon, as he sat among wooers, he\\nsaw Athene--and he went straight to the outer porch, for he\\nthought it blame in his heart that a stranger should stand\\nlong at the gates: and halting nigh her he clasped her\\nright hand and took from her the spear of bronze, and\\nuttered his voice and spake unto her winged words:\\n\\n\\'Hail, stranger, with us thou shalt be kindly entreated,\\nand thereafter, when thou hast tasted meat, thou shalt tell\\nus that whereof thou hast need.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he led the way, and Pallas Athene followed. And\\nwhen they were now within the lofty house, he set her spear\\nthat he bore against a tall pillar, within the polished\\nspear-stand, where stood many spears besides, even those of\\nOdysseus of the hardy heart; and he led the goddess and\\nseated her on a goodly carven chair, and spread a linen\\ncloth thereunder, and beneath was a footstool for the feet.\\nFor himself he placed an inlaid seat hard by, apart from\\nthe company of the wooers, lest the stranger should be\\ndisquieted by the noise and should have a loathing for the\\nmeal, being come among overweening men, and also that he\\nmight ask him about his father that was gone from his home.\\n\\nThen a handmaid bare water for the washing of hands in a\\ngoodly golden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin\\nto wash withal, and drew to their side a polished table.\\nAnd a grave dame bare wheaten bread and set it by them, and\\nlaid on the board many dainties, giving freely of such\\nthings as she had by her. And a carver lifted and placed by\\nthem platters of divers kinds of flesh, and nigh them he\\nset golden bowls, and a henchman walked to and fro pouring\\nout to them the wine.\\n\\nThen in came the lordly wooers; and they sat them down in\\nrows on chairs, and on high seats, and henchmen poured\\nwater on their hands, and maidservants piled wheaten bread\\nby them in baskets, and pages crowned the bowls with drink;\\nand they stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer\\nspread before them. Now when the wooers had put from them\\nthe desire of meat and drink, they minded them of other\\nthings, even of the song and dance: for these are the crown\\nof the feast. And a henchman placed a beauteous lyre in the\\nhands of Phemius, who was minstrel to the wooers despite\\nhis will. Yea and as he touched the lyre he lifted up his\\nvoice in sweet songs.{*}\\n\\n{* Or, according to the ordinary interpretation of [Greek]:\\nSo he touched the chords in prelude to his sweet singing.}\\n\\nBut Telemachus spake unto grey-eyed Athene, holding his\\nhead close to her that those others might not hear: \\'Dear\\nstranger, wilt thou of a truth be wroth at the word that I\\nshall say? Yonder men verily care for such things as these,\\nthe lyre and song, lightly, as they that devour the\\nlivelihood of another without atonement, of that man whose\\nwhite bones, it may be, lie wasting in the rain upon the\\nmainland, or the billow rolls them in the brine. Were but\\nthese men to see him returned to Ithaca, they all would\\npray rather for greater speed of foot than for gain of gold\\nand raiment. But now he hath perished, even so, an evil\\ndoom, and for us is no comfort, no, not though any of\\nearthly men should say that he will come again. Gone is the\\nday of his returning! But come declare me this, and tell me\\nall plainly: Who art thou of the sons of men, and whence?\\nWhere is thy city, where are they that begat thee? Say, on\\nwhat manner of ship didst thou come, and how did sailors\\nbring thee to Ithaca, and who did they avow themselves to\\nbe, for in nowise do I deem that thou camest hither by\\nland.  And herein tell me true, that I may know for a\\nsurety whether thou art a newcomer, or whether thou art a\\nguest of the house, seeing that many were the strangers\\nthat came to our home, for that HE too had voyaged much\\namong men.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: \\'Yea now,\\nI will plainly tell thee all. I avow me to be Mentes, son\\nof wise Anchialus, and I bear rule among the Taphians,\\nlovers of the oar. And now am I come to shore, as thou\\nseest, with ship and crew, sailing over the wine-dark sea,\\nunto men of strange speech, even to Temesa, {*} in quest of\\ncopper, and my cargo is shining iron. And there my ship is\\nlying toward the upland, away from the city, in the harbour\\nof Rheithron beneath wooded Neion: and we declare ourselves\\nto be friends one of the other, and of houses friendly,\\nfrom of old. Nay, if thou wouldest be assured, go ask the\\nold man, the hero Laertes, who they say no more comes to\\nthe city, but far away toward the upland suffers\\naffliction, with an ancient woman for his handmaid, who\\nsets by him meat and drink, whensoever weariness takes hold\\nof his limbs, as he creeps along the knoll of his vineyard\\nplot.  And now am I come; for verily they said that HE, thy\\nfather, was among his people; but lo, the gods withhold him\\nfrom his way. For goodly Odysseus hath not yet perished on\\nthe earth; but still, methinks, he lives and is kept on the\\nwide deep in a seagirt isle, and hard men constrain him,\\nwild folk that hold him, it may be, sore against his will.\\nBut now of a truth will I utter my word of prophecy, as the\\nImmortals bring it into my heart and as I deem it will be\\naccomplished, though no soothsayer am I, nor skilled in the\\nsigns of birds. Henceforth indeed for no long while shall\\nhe be far from his own dear country, not though bonds of\\niron bind him; he will advise him of a way to return, for\\nhe is a man of many devices. But come, declare me this, and\\ntell me all plainly, whether indeed, so tall as thou art,\\nthou art sprung from the loins of Odysseus. Thy head surely\\nand they beauteous eyes are wondrous like to his, since\\nfull many a time have we held converse together ere he\\nembarked for Troy, whither the others, aye the bravest of\\nthe Argives, went in hollow ships. From that day forth\\nneither have I seen Odysseus, nor he me.\\'\\n\\n{* Tamasia, in the mountainous centre of Cyprus.}\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered her, and said: \\'Yea, sir, now\\nwill I plainly tell thee all. My mother verily saith that I\\nam his; for myself I know not, for never man yet knew of\\nhimself his own descent. O that I had been the son of some\\nblessed man, whom old age overtook among his own\\npossessions! But now of him that is the most hapless of\\nmortal men, his son they say that I am, since thou dost\\nquestion me hereof.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake unto him, and\\nsaid: \\'Surely no nameless lineage have the gods ordained\\nfor thee in days to come, since Penelope bore thee so\\ngoodly a man. But come, declare me this, and tell it all\\nplainly. What feast, nay, what rout is this? What hast thou\\nto do therewith? Is it a clan drinking, or a wedding feast,\\nfor here we have no banquet where each man brings his\\nshare? In such wise, flown with insolence, do they seem to\\nme to revel wantonly through the house: and well might any\\nman be wroth to see so many deeds of shame, whatso wise man\\ncame among them.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered her, and said: \\'Sir,\\nforasmuch as thou questionest me of these things and\\ninquirest thereof, our house was once like to have been\\nrich and honourable, while yet that man was among his\\npeople. But now the gods willed it otherwise, in evil\\npurpose, who have made him pass utterly out of sight as no\\nman ever before.  Truly I would not even for his death make\\nso great sorrow, had he fallen among his fellows in the\\nland of the Trojans, or in the arms of his friends when he\\nhad wound up the clew of war. Then would the whole Achaean\\nhost have builded him a barrow, and even for his son would\\nhe have won great glory in the after days. But now the\\nspirits of the storm have swept him away inglorious. He is\\ngone, lost to sight and hearsay, but for me hath he left\\nanguish and lamentation; nor henceforth is it for him alone\\nthat I mourn and weep, since the gods have wrought for me\\nother sore distress. For all the noblest that are princes\\nin the isles, in Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus,\\nand as many as lord it in rocky Ithaca, all these woo my\\nmother and waste my house. But as for her she neither\\nrefuseth the hated bridal, nor hath the heart to make an\\nend: so they devour and minish my house, and ere long will\\nthey make havoc likewise of myself.\\'\\n\\nThen in heavy displeasure spake unto him Pallas Athene:\\n\\'God help thee! thou art surely sore in need of Odysseus\\nthat is afar, to stretch forth his hands upon the shameless\\nwooers.  If he could but come now and stand at the entering\\nin of the gate, with helmet and shield and lances twain, as\\nmighty a man as when first I marked him in our house\\ndrinking and making merry what time he came up out of\\nEphyra from Ilus son of Mermerus! For even thither had\\nOdysseus gone on his swift ship to seek a deadly drug, that\\nhe might have wherewithal to smear his bronze-shod arrows:\\nbut Ilus would in nowise give it to him, for he had in awe\\nthe everliving gods. But my father gave it him, for he bare\\nhim wondrous love. O that Odysseus might in such strength\\nconsort with the wooers: so should they all have swift fate\\nand bitter wedlock! Howbeit these things surely lie on the\\nknees of the gods, whether he shall return or not, and take\\nvengeance in his halls. But I charge thee to take counsel\\nhow thou mayest thrust forth the wooers from the hall. Come\\nnow, mark and take heed unto my words. On the morrow call\\nthe Achaean lords to the assembly, and declare thy saying\\nto all, and take the gods to witness. As for the wooers bid\\nthem scatter them each one to his own, and for thy mother,\\nif her heart is moved to marriage, let her go back to the\\nhall of that mighty man her father, and her kinsfolk will\\nfurnish a wedding feast, and array the gifts of wooing\\nexceeding many, all that should go back with a daughter\\ndearly beloved. And to thyself I will give a word of wise\\ncounsel, if perchance thou wilt hearken. Fit out a ship,\\nthe best thou hast, with twenty oarsmen, and go to inquire\\nconcerning thy father that is long afar, if perchance any\\nman shall tell thee aught, or if thou mayest hear the voice\\nfrom Zeus, which chiefly brings tidings to men. Get thee\\nfirst to Pylos and inquire of goodly Nestor, and from\\nthence to Sparta to Menelaus of the fair hair, for he came\\nhome the last of the mail-coated Achaeans. If thou shalt\\nhear news of the life and the returning of thy father, then\\nverily thou mayest endure the wasting for yet a year. But\\nif thou shalt hear that he is dead and gone, return then to\\nthine own dear country and pile his mound, and over it pay\\nburial rites, full many as is due, and give thy mother to a\\nhusband. But when thou hast done this and made an end,\\nthereafter take counsel in thy mind and heart, how thou\\nmayest slay the wooers in thy halls, whether by guile or\\nopenly; for thou shouldest not carry childish thoughts,\\nbeing no longer of years thereto. Or hast thou not heard\\nwhat renown the goodly Orestes gat him among all men in\\nthat he slew the slayer of his father, guileful Aegisthus,\\nwho killed his famous sire? And thou, too, my friend, for I\\nsee that thou art very comely and tall, be valiant, that\\neven men unborn may praise thee. But I will now go down to\\nthe swift ship and to my men, who methinks chafe much at\\ntarrying for me; and do thou thyself take heed and give ear\\nunto my words.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered her, saying: \\'Sir, verily\\nthou speakest these things out of a friendly heart, as a\\nfather to his son, and never will I forget them. But now I\\npray thee abide here, though eager to be gone, to the end\\nthat after thou hast bathed and had all thy heart\\'s desire,\\nthou mayest wend to the ship joyful in spirit, with a\\ncostly gift and very goodly, to be an heirloom of my\\ngiving, such as dear friends give to friends.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: \\'Hold me\\nnow no longer, that am eager for the way. But whatsoever\\ngift thine heart shall bid thee give me, when I am on my\\nway back let it be mine to carry home: bear from thy stores\\na gift right goodly, and it shall bring thee the worth\\nthereof in return.\\'\\n\\nSo spake she and departed, the grey-eyed Athene, and like\\nan eagle of the sea she flew away, but in his spirit she\\nplanted might and courage, and put him in mind of his\\nfather yet more than heretofore. And he marked the thing\\nand was amazed, for he deemed that it was a god; and anon\\nhe went among the wooers, a godlike man.\\n\\nNow the renowned minstrel was singing to the wooers, and\\nthey sat listening in silence; and his song was of the\\npitiful return of the Achaeans, that Pallas Athene laid on\\nthem as they came forth from Troy. And from her upper\\nchamber the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, caught the\\nglorious strain, and she went down the high stairs from her\\nchamber, not alone, for two of her handmaids bare her\\ncompany. Now when the fair lady had come unto the wooers,\\nshe stood by the pillar of the well-builded roof holding up\\nher glistening tire before her face; and a faithful maiden\\nstood on either side her. Then she fell a weeping, and\\nspake unto the divine minstrel:\\n\\n\\'Phemius, since thou knowest many other charms for mortals,\\ndeeds of men and gods, which bards rehearse, some one of\\nthese do thou sing as thou sittest by them, and let them\\ndrink their wine in silence; but cease from this pitiful\\nstrain, that ever wastes my heart within my breast, since\\nto me above all women hath come a sorrow comfortless. So\\ndear a head do I long for in constant memory, namely, that\\nman whose fame is noised abroad from Hellas to mid Argos.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered her, and said: \\'O my mother,\\nwhy then dost thou grudge the sweet minstrel to gladden us\\nas his spirit moves him? It is not minstrels who are in\\nfault, but Zeus, methinks, is in fault, who gives to men,\\nthat live by bread, to each one as he will. As for him it\\nis no blame if he sings the ill-faring of the Danaans; for\\nmen always prize that song the most, which rings newest in\\ntheir ears. But let thy heart and mind endure to listen,\\nfor not Odysseus only lost in Troy the day of his\\nreturning, but many another likewise perished. Howbeit go\\nto thy chamber and mind thine own housewiferies, the loom\\nand distaff, and bid thy handmaids ply their tasks. But\\nspeech shall be for men, for all, but for me in chief; for\\nmine is the lordship in the house.\\'\\n\\nThen in amaze she went back to her chamber, for she laid up\\nthe wise saying of her son in her heart. She ascended to\\nher upper chamber with the women her handmaids, and then\\nwas bewailing Odysseus, her dear lord, till grey-eyed\\nAthene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\\n\\nNow the wooers clamoured throughout the shadowy halls, and\\neach one uttered a prayer to be her bedfellow. And wise\\nTelemachus first spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Wooers of my mother, men despiteful out of measure, let us\\nfeast now and make merry and let there be no brawling; for,\\nlo, it is a good thing to list to a minstrel such as him,\\nlike to the gods in voice. But in the morning let us all go\\nto the assembly and sit us down, that I may declare my\\nsaying outright, to wit that ye leave these halls: and busy\\nyourselves with other feasts, eating your own substance,\\ngoing in turn from house to house. But if ye deem this a\\nlikelier and a better thing, that one man\\'s goods should\\nperish without atonement, then waste ye as ye will; and I\\nwill call upon the everlasting gods, if haply Zeus may\\ngrant that acts of recompense be made: so should ye\\nhereafter perish within the halls without atonement.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and all that heard him bit their lips and\\nmarvelled at Telemachus, in that he spake boldly.\\n\\nThen Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: \\'Telemachus,\\nin very truth the gods themselves instruct thee to be proud\\nof speech and boldly to harangue. Never may Cronion make\\nthee king in seagirt Ithaca, which thing is of inheritance\\nthy right!\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, and said: \\'Antinous,\\nwilt thou indeed be wroth at the word that I shall say?\\nYea, at the hand of Zeus would I be fain to take even this\\nthing upon me. Sayest thou that this is the worst hap that\\ncan befal a man? Nay, verily, it is no ill thing to be a\\nking: the house of such an one quickly waxeth rich and\\nhimself is held in greater honour. Howsoever there are many\\nother kings of the Achaeans in seagirt Ithaca, kings young\\nand old; someone of them shall surely have this kingship\\nsince goodly Odysseus is dead. But as for me, I will be\\nlord of our own house and thralls, that goodly Odysseus gat\\nme with his spear.\\'\\n\\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him, saying:\\n\\'Telemachus, on the knees of the gods it surely lies, what\\nman is to be king over the Achaeans in seagirt Ithaca. But\\nmayest thou keep thine own possessions and be lord in thine\\nown house! Never may that man come, who shall wrest from\\nthee thy substance violently in thine own despite while\\nIthaca yet stands. But I would ask thee, friend, concerning\\nthe stranger--whence he is, and of what land he avows him\\nto be? Where are his kin and his native fields? Doth he\\nbear some tidings of thy father on his road, or cometh he\\nthus to speed some matter of his own? In such wise did he\\nstart up, and lo, he was gone, nor tarried he that we\\nshould know him;--and yet he seemed no mean man to look\\nupon.\\' {*}\\n\\n{* The [Greek] explains the expression of surprise at the\\nsudden departure of the stranger.}\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, and said: \\'Eurymachus,\\nsurely the day of my father\\'s returning hath gone by.\\nTherefore no more do I put faith in tidings, whencesoever\\nthey may come, neither have I regard unto any divination,\\nwhereof my mother may inquire at the lips of a diviner,\\nwhen she hath bidden him to the hall. But as for that man,\\nhe is a friend of my house from Taphos, and he avows him to\\nbe Mentes, son of wise Anchialus, and he hath lordship\\namong the Taphians, lovers of the oar.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Telemachus, but in his heart he knew the deathless\\ngoddess. Now the wooers turned them to the dance and the\\ndelightsome song, and made merry, and waited till evening\\nshould come on. And as they made merry, dusk evening came\\nupon them. Then they went each one to his own house to lie\\ndown to rest.\\n\\nBut Telemachus, where his chamber was builded high up in\\nthe fair court, in a place with wide prospect, thither\\nbetook him to his bed, pondering many thoughts in his mind;\\nand with him went trusty Eurycleia, and bare for him\\ntorches burning. She was the daughter of Ops, son of\\nPeisenor, and Laertes bought her on a time with his wealth,\\nwhile as yet she was in her first youth, and gave for her\\nthe worth of twenty oxen. And he honoured her even as he\\nhonoured his dear wife in the halls, but he never lay with\\nher, for he shunned the wrath of his lady. She went with\\nTelemachus and bare for him the burning torches: and of all\\nthe women of the household she loved him most, and she had\\nnursed him when a little one. Then he opened the doors of\\nthe well-builded chamber and sat him on the bed and took\\noff his soft doublet, and put it in the wise old woman\\'s\\nhands. So she folded the doublet and smoothed it, and hung\\nit on a pin by the jointed bedstead, and went forth on her\\nway from the room, and pulled to the door with the silver\\nhandle, and drew home the bar with the thong. There, all\\nnight through, wrapped in a fleece of wool, he meditated in\\nhis heart upon the journey that Athene had showed him.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook II\\n\\n  Telemachus complains in vain, and borrowing a ship, goes\\n  secretly to Pylos by night. And how he was there received.\\n\\nNow so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,\\nthe dear son of Odysseus gat him up from his bed, and put\\non his raiment and cast his sharp sword about his shoulder,\\nand beneath his smooth feet he bound his goodly sandals,\\nand stept forth from his chamber in presence like a god.\\nAnd straightway he bade the clear-voiced heralds to call\\nthe long-haired Achaeans to the assembly. And the heralds\\ncalled the gathering, and the Achaeans were assembled\\nquickly. Now when they were gathered and come together, he\\nwent on his way to the assembly holding in his hand a spear\\nof bronze,--not alone he went, for two swift hounds bare\\nhim company. Then Athene shed on him a wondrous grace, and\\nall the people marvelled at him as he came. And he sat him\\nin his father\\'s seat and the elders gave place to him.\\n\\nThen the lord Aegyptus spake among them first; bowed was he\\nwith age, and skilled in things past number. Now for this\\nreason he spake that his dear son, the warrior Antiphus,\\nhad gone in the hollow ships to Ilios of the goodly steeds;\\nbut the savage Cyclops slew him in his hollow cave, and\\nmade of him then his latest meal. Three other sons Aegyptus\\nhad, and one consorted with the wooers, namely Eurynomus,\\nbut two continued in their father\\'s fields; yet even so\\nforgat he not that son, still mourning and sorrowing. So\\nweeping for his sake he made harangue and spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Hearken now to me, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I\\nshall say. Never hath our assembly or session been since\\nthe day that goodly Odysseus departed in the hollow ships.\\nAnd now who was minded thus to assemble us? On what man\\nhath such sore need come, of the young men or of the elder\\nborn? Hath he heard some tidings of the host now returning,\\nwhich he might plainly declare to us, for that he first\\nlearned thereof, or doth he show forth and tell some other\\nmatter of the common weal? Methinks he is a true man--good\\nluck be with him! Zeus vouchsafe him some good thing in his\\nturn, even all his heart\\'s desire!\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and the dear son of Odysseus was glad at the\\nomen of the word; nor sat he now much longer, but he burned\\nto speak, and he stood in mid assembly; and the herald\\nPeisenor, skilled in sage counsels, placed the staff in his\\nhands. Then he spake, accosting the old man first:\\n\\n\\'Old man, he is not far off, and soon shalt thou know it\\nfor thyself, he who called the folk together, even I: for\\nsorrow hath come to me in chief. Neither have I heard any\\ntidings of the host now returning, which I may plainly\\ndeclare to you, for that I first learned thereof; neither\\ndo I show forth or tell any other matter of the common\\nweal, but mine own need, for that evil hath befallen my\\nhouse, a double woe. First, I have lost my noble sire, who\\nsometime was king among you here, and was gentle as a\\nfather; and now is there an evil yet greater far, which\\nsurely shall soon make grievous havoc of my whole house and\\nruin all my livelihood. My mother did certain wooers beset\\nsore against her will, even the sons of those men that here\\nare the noblest. They are too craven to go to the house of\\nher father Icarius, that he may himself set the bride-price\\nfor his daughter, and bestow her on whom he will, even on\\nhim who finds favour in his sight. But they resorting to\\nour house day by day sacrifice oxen and sheep and fat\\ngoats, and keep revel, and drink the dark wine recklessly,\\nand lo, our great wealth is wasted, for there is no man now\\nalive such as Odysseus was, to keep ruin from the house. As\\nfor me I am nowise strong like him to ward mine own; verily\\nto the end of my days {*} shall I be a weakling and all\\nunskilled in prowess. Truly I would defend me if but\\nstrength were mine; for deeds past sufferance have now been\\nwrought, and now my house is wasted utterly beyond pretence\\nof right. Resent it in your own hearts, and have regard to\\nyour neighbours who dwell around, and tremble ye at the\\nanger of the gods, lest haply they turn upon you in wrath\\nat your evil deeds. {Or, lest they bring your evil deeds in\\nwrath on your own heads.} I pray you by Olympian Zeus and\\nby Themis, who looseth and gathereth the meetings of men,\\nlet be, my friends, and leave me alone to waste in bitter\\ngrief;-- unless it so be that my father, the good Odysseus,\\nout of evil heart wrought harm to the goodly-greaved\\nAchaeans, in quittance whereof ye now work me harm out of\\nevil hearts, and spur on these men. Better for me that ye\\nyourselves should eat up my treasures and my flocks. Were\\nYE so to devour them, ere long would some recompense be\\nmade, for we would urge our plea throughout the town,\\nbegging back our substance, until all should be restored.\\nBut now without remedy are the pains that ye lay up in my\\nheart.\\'\\n\\n{* Cf. B. xxi. 131. For the use of the 1st pers. pl. like\\nour ROYAL plural, cf. B. xvi.44, Il. vii. 190.}\\n\\nSo spake he in wrath, and dashed the staff to the ground,\\nand brake forth in tears; and pity fell on all the people.\\nThen all the others held their peace, and none had the\\nheart to answer Telemachus with hard words, but Antinous\\nalone made answer, saying:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, proud of speech and unrestrained in fury, what\\nis this thou hast said to put us to shame, and wouldest\\nfasten on us reproach? Behold the fault is not in the\\nAchaean wooers, but in thine own mother, for she is the\\ncraftiest of women. For it is now the third year, and the\\nfourth is fast going by, since she began to deceive the\\nminds of the Achaeans in their breasts. She gives hope to\\nall, and makes promises to every man, and sends them\\nmessages, but her mind is set on other things. And she hath\\ndevised in her heart this wile besides; she set up in her\\nhalls a mighty web, fine of woof and very wide, whereat she\\nwould weave, and anon she spake among us:\\n\\n\\'\"Ye princely youths, my wooers, now that the goodly\\nOdysseus is dead, do ye abide patiently, how eager soever\\nto speed on this marriage of mine, till I finish the robe.\\nI would not that the threads perish to no avail, even this\\nshroud for the hero Laertes, against the day when the\\nruinous doom shall bring him low, of death that lays men at\\ntheir length. So shall none of the Achaean women in the\\nland count it blame in me, as well might be, were he to lie\\nwithout a winding-sheet, a man that had gotten great\\npossessions.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, and our high hearts consented thereto. So\\nthen in the day time she would weave the mighty web, and in\\nthe night unravel the same, when she had let place the\\ntorches by her. Thus for the space of three years she hid\\nthe thing by craft and beguiled the minds of the Achaeans;\\nbut when the fourth year arrived and the seasons came\\nround, then at the last one of her women who knew all\\ndeclared it, and we found her unravelling the splendid web.\\nThus she finished it perforce and sore against her will.\\nBut as for thee, the wooers make thee answer thus, that\\nthou mayest know it in thine own heart, thou and all the\\nAchaeans! Send away thy mother, and bid her be married to\\nwhomsoever her father commands, and whoso is well pleasing\\nunto her. But if she will continue for long to vex the sons\\nof the Achaeans, pondering in her heart those things that\\nAthene hath given her beyond women, knowledge of all fair\\nhandiwork, yea, and cunning wit, and wiles--so be it! Such\\nwiles as hers we have never yet heard that any even of the\\nwomen of old did know, of those that aforetime were\\nfair-tressed Achaean ladies, Tyro, and Alcmene, and Mycene\\nwith the bright crown. Not one of these in the imaginations\\nof their hearts was like unto Penelope, yet herein at least\\nher imagining was not good. For in despite of her the\\nwooers will devour thy living and thy substance, so long as\\nshe is steadfast in such purpose as the gods now put within\\nher breast: great renown for herself she winneth, but for\\nthee regret for thy much livelihood. But we will neither go\\nto our own lands, nor otherwhere, till she marry that man\\nwhom she will of the Achaeans.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Antinous, I may\\nin no wise thrust forth from the house, against her will,\\nthe woman that bare me, that reared me: while as for my\\nfather he is abroad on the earth, whether he be alive or\\ndead. Moreover it is hard for me to make heavy restitution\\nto Icarius, as needs I must, if of mine own will I send my\\nmother away. For I shall have evil at his hand, at the hand\\nof her father, and some god will give me more besides, for\\nmy mother will call down the dire Avengers as she departs\\nfrom the house, and I shall have blame of men; surely then\\nI will never speak this word. Nay, if your own heart, even\\nyours, is indignant, quit ye my halls, and busy yourselves\\nwith other feasts, eating your own substance, and going in\\nturn from house to house. But if ye deem this a likelier\\nand a better thing, that one man\\'s goods should perish\\nwithout atonement, then waste ye as ye will: and I will\\ncall upon the everlasting gods, if haply Zeus may grant\\nthat acts of recompense be made: so should ye hereafter\\nperish in the halls without atonement.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Telemachus, and in answer to his prayer did Zeus,\\nof the far borne voice, send forth two eagles in flight,\\nfrom on high, from the mountain-crest. Awhile they flew as\\nfleet as the blasts of the wind, side by side, with\\nstraining of their pinions. But when they had now reached\\nthe mid assembly, the place of many voices, there they\\nwheeled about and flapped their strong wings, and looked\\ndown upon the heads of all, and destruction was in their\\ngaze. Then tore they with their talons each the other\\'s\\ncheeks and neck on every side, and so sped to the right\\nacross the dwellings and the city of the people. And the\\nmen marvelled at the birds when they had sight of them, and\\npondered in their hearts the things that should come to\\npass. Yea and the old man, the lord Halitherses son of\\nMastor spake among them, for he excelled his peers in\\nknowledge of birds, and in uttering words of fate. With\\ngood will he made harangue and spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I\\nshall say: and mainly to the wooers do I show forth and\\ntell these things, seeing that a mighty woe is rolling upon\\nthem. For Odysseus shall not long be away from his friends,\\nnay, even now, it may be, he is near, and sowing the seeds\\nof death and fate for these men, every one; and he will be\\na bane to many another likewise of us who dwell in\\nclear-seen Ithaca. But long ere that falls out let us\\nadvise us how we may make an end of their mischief; yea,\\nlet them of their own selves make an end, for this is the\\nbetter way for them, as will soon be seen. For I prophesy\\nnot as one unproved, but with sure knowledge; verily, I\\nsay, that for him all things now are come to pass, even as\\nI told him, what time the Argives embarked for Ilios, and\\nwith them went the wise Odysseus. I said that after sore\\naffliction, with the loss of all his company, unknown to\\nall, in the twentieth year he should come home. And behold,\\nall these things now have an end.\\'\\n\\nAnd Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him, saying: \\'Go\\nnow, old man, get thee home and prophesy to thine own\\nchildren, lest haply they suffer harm hereafter: but herein\\nam I a far better prophet than thou. Howbeit there be many\\nbirds that fly to and fro under the sun\\'s rays, but all are\\nnot birds of fate. Now as for Odysseus, he hath perished\\nfar away, as would that thou too with him hadst been cut\\noff: so wouldst thou not have babbled thus much prophecy,\\nnor wouldst thou hound on Telemachus that is already\\nangered, expecting a gift for thy house, if perchance he\\nmay vouchsafe thee aught. But now will I speak out, and my\\nword shall surely be accomplished. If thou that knowest\\nmuch lore from of old, shalt beguile with words a younger\\nman, and rouse him to indignation, first it shall be a\\ngreat grief to him:--and yet he can count on no aid from\\nthese who hear him;--while upon thee, old man, we will lay\\na fine, that thou mayest pay it and chafe at heart, and\\nsore pain shall be thine. And I myself will give a word of\\ncounsel to Telemachus in presence of you all. Let him\\ncommand his mother to return to her father\\'s house; and her\\nkinsfolk will furnish a wedding feast, and array the gifts\\nof wooing, exceeding many, all that should go back with a\\ndaughter dearly beloved. For ere that, I trow, we sons of\\nthe Achaeans will not cease from our rough wooing, since,\\ncome what may, we fear not any man, no, not Telemachus,\\nfull of words though he be, nor soothsaying do we heed,\\nwhereof thou, old man, pratest idly, and art hated yet the\\nmore. His substance too shall be woefully devoured, nor\\nshall recompense ever be made, so long as she shall put off\\nthe Achaeans in the matter of her marriage; while we in\\nexpectation, from day to day, vie one with another for the\\nprize of her perfection, nor go we after other women whom\\nit were meet that we should each one wed.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him saying: \\'Eurymachus, and\\nye others, that are lordly wooers, I entreat you no more\\nconcerning this nor speak thereof, for the gods have\\nknowledge of it now and all the Achaeans. But come, give me\\na swift ship and twenty men, who shall accomplish for me my\\nvoyage to and fro. For I will go to Sparta and to sandy\\nPylos to inquire concerning the return of my father that is\\nlong afar, if perchance any man shall tell me aught, or if\\nI may hear the voice from Zeus, that chiefly brings tidings\\nto men. If I shall hear news of the life and the returning\\nof my father, then verily I may endure the wasting for yet\\na year; but if I shall hear that he is dead and gone, let\\nme then return to my own dear country, and pile his mound,\\nand over it pay burial rites full many as is due, and I\\nwill give my mother to a husband.\\'\\n\\nSo with that word he sat him down; then in the midst uprose\\nMentor, the companion of noble Odysseus. He it was to whom\\nOdysseus, as he departed in the fleet, had given the charge\\nover all his house, that it should obey the old man, and\\nthat he should keep all things safe. With good will he now\\nmade harangue and spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I\\nshall say. Henceforth let not any sceptred king be kind and\\ngentle with all his heart, nor minded to do righteously,\\nbut let him alway be a hard man and work unrighteousness:\\nfor behold, there is none that remembereth divine Odysseus\\nof the people whose lord he was, and was gentle as a\\nfather. Howsoever, it is not that I grudge the lordly\\nwooers their deeds of violence in the evil devices of their\\nheart. For at the hazard of their own heads they violently\\ndevour the household of Odysseus, and say of him that he\\nwill come no more again. But I am indeed wroth with the\\nrest of the people, to see how ye all sit thus speechless,\\nand do not cry shame upon the wooers, and put them down, ye\\nthat are so many and they so few.\\'\\n\\nAnd Leocritus, son of Euenor, answered him, saying: \\'Mentor\\ninfatuate, with thy wandering wits, what word hast thou\\nspoken, that callest upon them to put us down? Nay, it is a\\nhard thing to fight about a feast, and that with men who\\nare even more in number than you. Though Odysseus of Ithaca\\nhimself should come and were eager of heart to drive forth\\nfrom the hall the lordly wooers that feast throughout his\\nhouse, yet should his wife have no joy of his coming,\\nthough she yearns for him;--but even there should he meet\\nfoul doom, if he fought with those that outnumbered him; so\\nthou hast not spoken aright. But as for the people, come\\nnow, scatter yourselves each one to his own lands, but\\nMentor and Halitherses will speed this man\\'s voyage, for\\nthey are friends of his house from of old. Yet after all,\\nmethinks, that long time he will abide and seek tidings in\\nIthaca, and never accomplish this voyage.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and in haste they broke up the assembly. So\\nthey were scattered each one to his own dwelling, while the\\nwooers departed to the house of divine Odysseus.\\n\\nThen Telemachus, going far apart to the shore of the sea,\\nlaved his hands in the grey sea water, and prayed unto\\nAthene, saying: \\'Hear me, thou who yesterday didst come in\\nthy godhead to our house, and badest me go in a ship across\\nthe misty seas, to seek tidings of the return of my father\\nthat is long gone: but all this my purpose do the Achaeans\\ndelay, and mainly the wooers in the naughtiness of their\\npride.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he in prayer, and Athene drew nigh him in the\\nlikeness of Mentor, in fashion and in voice, and she spake\\nand hailed him in winged words:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, even hereafter thou shalt not be craven or\\nwitless, if indeed thou hast a drop of thy father\\'s blood\\nand a portion of his spirit; such an one was he to fulfil\\nboth word and work. Nor, if this be so, shall thy voyage be\\nvain or unfulfilled. But if thou art not the very seed of\\nhim and of Penelope, then have I no hope that thou wilt\\naccomplish thy desire. For few children, truly, are like\\ntheir father; lo, the more part are worse, yet a few are\\nbetter than the sire. But since thou shalt not even\\nhereafter be craven or witless, nor hath the wisdom of\\nOdysseus failed thee quite, so is there good hope of thine\\naccomplishing this work. Wherefore now take no heed of the\\ncounsel or the purpose of the senseless wooers, for they\\nare in no way wise or just: neither know they aught of\\ndeath and of black fate, which already is close upon them,\\nthat they are all to perish in one day. But the voyage on\\nwhich thy heart is set shall not long be lacking to\\nthee--so faithful a friend of thy father am I, who will\\nfurnish thee a swift ship and myself be thy companion. But\\ngo thou to the house, and consort with the wooers, and make\\nready corn, and bestow all in vessels, the wine in jars and\\nbarley-flour, the marrow of men, in well-sewn skins; and I\\nwill lightly gather in the township a crew that offer\\nthemselves willingly. There are many ships, new and old, in\\nseagirt Ithaca; of these I will choose out the best for\\nthee, and we will quickly rig her and launch her on the\\nbroad deep.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Athene, daughter of Zeus, and Telemachus made no\\nlong tarrying, when he had heard the voice of the goddess.\\nHe went on his way towards the house, heavy at heart, and\\nthere he found the noble wooers in the halls, flaying goats\\nand singeing swine in the court. And Antinous laughed out\\nand went straight to Telemachus, and clasped his hand and\\nspake and hailed him:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, proud of speech and unrestrained in fury, let\\nno evil word any more be in thy heart, nor evil work, but\\nlet me see thee eat and drink as of old. And the Achaeans\\nwill make thee ready all things without fail, a ship and\\nchosen oarsmen, that thou mayest come the quicker to fair\\nPylos, to seek tidings of thy noble father.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying, \\'Antinous, in no\\nwise in your proud company can I sup in peace, and make\\nmerry with a quiet mind. Is it a little thing, ye wooers,\\nthat in time past ye wasted many good things of my getting,\\nwhile as yet I was a child? But now that I am a man grown,\\nand learn the story from the lips of others, and my spirit\\nwaxeth within me, I will seek to let loose upon you evil\\nfates, as I may, going either to Pylos for help, or abiding\\nhere in this township. Yea, I will go, nor vain shall the\\nvoyage be whereof I speak; a passenger on another\\'s ship go\\nI, for I am not to have a ship nor oarsmen of mine own; so\\nin your wisdom ye have thought it for the better.\\'\\n\\nHe spake and snatched his hand from out the hand of\\nAntinous, lightly, and all the while the wooers were busy\\nfeasting through the house; and they mocked him and sharply\\ntaunted him, and thus would some proud youth speak:\\n\\n\\'In very truth Telemachus planneth our destruction. He will\\nbring a rescue either from sandy Pylos, or even it may be\\nfrom Sparta, so terribly is he set on slaying us. Or else\\nhe will go to Ephyra, a fruitful land, to fetch a poisonous\\ndrug that he may cast it into the bowl and make an end of\\nall of us.\\'\\n\\nAnd again another proud youth would say: \\'Who knows but\\nthat he himself if he goes hence on the hollow ship, may\\nperish wandering far from his friends, even as Odysseus? So\\nshould we have yet more ado, for then must we divide among\\nus all his substance, and moreover give the house to his\\nmother to possess it, and to him whosoever should wed her.\\'\\n\\nSo spake they; but he stepped down into the vaulted\\ntreasure-chamber of his father, a spacious room, where gold\\nand bronze lay piled, and raiment in coffers, and fragrant\\nolive oil in plenty. And there stood casks of sweet wine\\nand old, full of the unmixed drink divine, all orderly\\nranged by the wall, ready if ever Odysseus should come\\nhome, albeit after travail and much pain. And the\\nclose-fitted doors, the folding doors, were shut, and night\\nand day there abode within a dame in charge, who guarded\\nall in the fulness of her wisdom, Eurycleia, daughter of\\nOps son of Peisenor. Telemachus now called her into the\\nchamber and spake unto her, saying:\\n\\n\\'Mother, come draw off for me sweet wine in jars, the\\nchoicest next to that thou keepest mindful ever of that\\nill-fated one, Odysseus, of the seed of Zeus, if perchance\\nhe may come I know not whence, having avoided death and the\\nfates. So fill twelve jars, and close each with his lid,\\nand pour me barley-meal into well-sewn skins, and let there\\nbe twenty measures of the grain of bruised barley-meal. Let\\nnone know this but thyself! As for these things let them\\nall be got together; for in the evening I will take them\\nwith me, at the time that my mother hath gone to her upper\\nchamber and turned her thoughts to sleep. Lo, to Sparta I\\ngo and to sandy Pylos to seek tidings of my dear father\\'s\\nreturn, if haply I may hear thereof.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and the good nurse Eurycleia wailed aloud, and\\nmaking lament spake to him winged words: \\'Ah, wherefore,\\ndear child, hath such a thought arisen in thine heart? How\\nshouldst thou fare over wide lands, thou that art an only\\nchild and well-beloved? As for him he hath perished,\\nOdysseus of the seed of Zeus, far from his own country in\\nthe land of strangers. And yonder men, so soon as thou art\\ngone, will devise mischief against thee thereafter, that\\nthou mayest perish by guile, and they will share among them\\nall this wealth of thine. Nay, abide here, settled on thine\\nown lands: thou hast no need upon the deep unharvested to\\nsuffer evil and go wandering.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered her, saying: \\'Take heart,\\nnurse, for lo, this my purpose came not but of a god. But\\nswear to tell no word thereof to my dear mother, till at\\nleast it shall be the eleventh or twelfth day from hence,\\nor till she miss me of herself, and hear of my departure,\\nthat so she may not mar her fair face with her tears.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and the old woman sware a great oath by the\\ngods not to reveal it. But when she had sworn and done that\\noath, straightway she drew off the wine for him in jars,\\nand poured barley-meal into well-sewn skins, and Telemachus\\ndeparted to the house and consorted with the wooers.\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to other\\nthoughts. In the likeness of Telemachus she went all\\nthrough the city, and stood by each one of the men and\\nspake her saying, and bade them gather at even by the swift\\nship. Furthermore, she craved a swift ship of Noemon,\\nfamous son of Phronius, and right gladly he promised it.\\n\\nNow the sun sank and all the ways were darkened. Then at\\nlength she let drag the swift ship to the sea and stored\\nwithin it all such tackling as decked ships carry. And she\\nmoored it at the far end of the harbour and the good\\ncompany was gathered together, and the goddess cheered on\\nall.\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to other\\nthoughts. She went on her way to the house of divine\\nOdysseus; and there she shed sweet sleep upon the wooers\\nand made them distraught in their drinking, and cast the\\ncups from their hands. And they arose up to go to rest\\nthroughout the city, nor sat they yet a long while, for\\nslumber was falling on their eyelids. Now grey eyed Athene\\nspake unto Telemachus, and called him from out the\\nfair-lying halls, taking the likeness of Mentor, both in\\nfashion and in voice:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, thy goodly-greaved companions are sitting\\nalready at their oars, it is thy despatch they are\\nawaiting. Nay then, let us go, that we delay them not long\\nfrom the way.\\'\\n\\nTherewith Pallas Athene led the way quickly, and he\\nfollowed hard in the steps of the goddess. Now when they\\nhad come down to the ship and to the sea, they found the\\nlong-haired youths of the company on the shore; and the\\nmighty prince Telemachus spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Come hither, friends, let us carry the corn on board, for\\nall is now together in the room, and my mother knows nought\\nthereof, nor any of the maidens of the house: one woman\\nonly heard my saying.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake and led the way, and they went with him. So\\nthey brought all and stowed it in the decked ship,\\naccording to the word of the dear son of Odysseus. Then\\nTelemachus climbed the ship, and Athene went before him,\\nand behold, she sat her down in the stern, and near her sat\\nTelemachus. And the men loosed the hawsers and climbed on\\nboard themselves and sat down upon the benches. And\\ngrey-eyed Athene sent them a favourable gale, a fresh West\\nWind, singing over the wine-dark sea.\\n\\nAnd Telemachus called unto his company and bade them lay\\nhands on the tackling, and they hearkened to his call. So\\nthey raised the mast of pine tree and set it in the hole of\\nthe cross plank, and made it fast with forestays, and\\nhauled up the white sails with twisted ropes of oxhide. And\\nthe wind filled the belly of the sail, and the dark wave\\nseethed loudly round the stem of the running ship, and she\\nfleeted over the wave, accomplishing her path. Then they\\nmade all fast in the swift black ship, and set mixing bowls\\nbrimmed with wine, and poured drink offering to the\\ndeathless gods that are from everlasting, and in chief to\\nthe grey eyed daughter of Zeus. So all night long and\\nthrough the dawn the ship cleft her way.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook III\\n\\n  Nestor entertains Telemachus at Pylos and tells him how the\\n  Greeks departed from Troy; and sends him for further\\n  information to Sparta.\\n\\nNow the sun arose and left the lovely mere, speeding to the\\nbrazen heaven, to give light to the immortals and to mortal\\nmen on the earth, the graingiver, and they reached Pylos,\\nthe stablished castle of Neleus. There the people were\\ndoing sacrifice on the sea shore, slaying black bulls\\nwithout spot to the dark-haired god, the shaker of the\\nearth. Nine companies there were, and five hundred men sat\\nin each, and in every company they held nine bulls ready to\\nhand. Just as they had tasted the inner parts, and were\\nburning the slices of the thighs on the altar to the god,\\nthe others were bearing straight to land, and brailed up\\nthe sails of the gallant ship, and moored her, and\\nthemselves came forth. And Telemachus too stept forth from\\nthe ship, and Athene led the way. And the goddess,\\ngrey-eyed Athene, spake first to him, saying:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, thou needst not now be abashed, no, not one\\nwhit. For to this very end didst thou sail over the deep,\\nthat thou mightest hear tidings of thy father, even where\\nthe earth closed over him, and what manner of death he met.\\nBut come now, go straight to Nestor, tamer of horses: let\\nus learn what counsel he hath in the secret of his heart.\\nAnd beseech him thyself that he may give unerring answer;\\nand he will not lie to thee, for he is very wise.\\'\\n\\nThe wise Telemachus answered, saying: \\'Mentor, and how\\nshall I go, how shall I greet him, I, who am untried in\\nwords of wisdom? Moreover a young man may well be abashed\\nto question an elder.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again:\\n\\'Telemachus, thou shalt bethink thee of somewhat in thine\\nown breast, and somewhat the god will give thee to say. For\\nthou, methinks, of all men wert not born and bred without\\nthe will of the gods.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Pallas Athene and led the way quickly; and he\\nfollowed hard in the steps of the goddess. And they came to\\nthe gathering and the session of the men of Pylos. There\\nwas Nestor seated with his sons, and round him his company\\nmaking ready the feast, and roasting some of the flesh and\\nspitting other. Now when they saw the strangers, they went\\nall together, and clasped their hands in welcome, and would\\nhave them sit down. First Peisistratus, son of Nestor, drew\\nnigh, and took the hands of each, and made them to sit down\\nat the feast on soft fleeces upon the sea sand, beside his\\nbrother Thrasymedes and his father. And he gave them messes\\nof the inner meat, and poured wine into a golden cup, and\\npledging her, he spake unto Pallas Athene, daughter of\\nZeus, lord of the aegis:\\n\\n\\'Pray now, my guest, to the lord Poseidon, even as it is\\nhis feast whereon ye have chanced in coming hither. And\\nwhen thou hast made drink offering and prayed, as is due,\\ngive thy friend also the cup of honeyed wine to make\\noffering thereof, inasmuch as he too, methinks, prayeth to\\nthe deathless gods, for all men stand in need of the gods.\\nHowbeit he is younger and mine own equal in years,\\ntherefore to thee first will I give the golden chalice.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he placed in her hand the cup of sweet wine. And\\nAthene rejoiced in the wisdom and judgment of the man, in\\nthat he had given to her first the chalice of gold. And\\nstraightway she prayed, and that instantly, to the lord\\nPoseidon:\\n\\n\\'Hear me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth, and grudge not\\nthe fulfilment of this labour in answer to our prayer. To\\nNestor first and to his sons vouchsafe renown, and\\nthereafter grant to all the people of Pylos a gracious\\nrecompense for this splendid hecatomb. Grant moreover that\\nTelemachus and I may return, when we have accomplished that\\nfor which we came hither with our swift black ship.\\'\\n\\nNow as she prayed on this wise, herself the while was\\nfulfilling the prayer. And she gave Telemachus the fair\\ntwo-handled cup; and in like manner prayed the dear son of\\nOdysseus. Then, when the others had roasted the outer parts\\nand drawn them off the spits, they divided the messes and\\nshared the glorious feast. But when they had put from them\\nthe desire of meat and drink, Nestor of Gerenia, lord of\\nchariots, first spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Now is the better time to enquire and ask of the strangers\\nwho they are, now that they have had their delight of food.\\nStrangers, who are ye? Whence sail ye over the wet ways? On\\nsome trading enterprise, or at adventure do ye rove, even\\nas sea-robbers, over the brine, for they wander at hazard\\nof their own lives bringing bale to alien men?\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him and spake with courage,\\nfor Athene herself had put boldness in his heart, that he\\nmight ask about his father who was afar, and that he might\\nbe had in good report among men:\\n\\n\\'Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaeans, thou\\naskest whence we are, and I will surely tell thee all. We\\nhave come forth out of Ithaca that is below Neion; and this\\nour quest whereof I speak is a matter of mine own, and not\\nof the common weal. I follow after the far-spread rumour of\\nmy father, if haply I may hear thereof, even of the goodly\\nsteadfast Odysseus, who upon a time, men say, fought by thy\\nside and sacked the city of the Trojans. For of all the\\nothers, as many as warred with the Trojans, we hear\\ntidings, and where each one fell by a pitiful death; but\\neven the death of this man Cronion hath left untold. For\\nnone can surely declare the place where he hath perished,\\nwhether he was smitten by foemen on the mainland, or lost\\nupon the deep among the waves of Amphitrite. So now am I\\ncome hither to thy knees, if perchance thou art willing to\\ntell me of his pitiful death, as one that saw it with thine\\nown eyes, or heard the story from some other wanderer,--\\nfor his mother bare him to exceeding sorrow. And speak me\\nno soft words in ruth or pity, but tell me plainly what\\nsight thou didst get of him. Ah! I pray thee, if ever at\\nall my father, noble Odysseus, made promise to thee of word\\nor work, and fulfilled the same in the land of the Trojans,\\nwhere ye Achaeans suffered affliction; these things, I pray\\nthee, now remember and tell me truth.\\'\\n\\nThen Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, answered him: \\'My\\nfriend, since thou hast brought sorrow back to mind,\\nbehold, this is the story of the woe which we endured in\\nthat land, we sons of the Achaeans, unrestrained in fury,\\nand of all that we bore in wanderings after spoil, sailing\\nwith our ships over the misty deep, wheresoever Achilles\\nled; and of all our war round the mighty burg of king\\nPriam. Yea and there the best of us were slain. There lies\\nvaliant Aias, and there Achilles, and there Patroclus, the\\npeer of the gods in counsel, and there my own dear son,\\nstrong and noble, Antilochus, that excelled in speed of\\nfoot and in the fight. And many other ills we suffered\\nbeside these; who of mortal men could tell the tale? Nay\\nnone, though thou wert to abide here for five years, ay and\\nfor six, and ask of all the ills which the goodly Achaeans\\nthen endured. Ere all was told thou wouldst be weary and\\nturn to thine own country. For nine whole years we were\\nbusy about them, devising their ruin with all manner of\\ncraft; and scarce did Cronion bring it to pass. There never\\na man durst match with him in wisdom, for goodly Odysseus\\nvery far outdid the rest in all manner of craft, Odysseus\\nthy father, if indeed thou art his son,--amazement comes\\nupon me as I look at thee; for verily thy speech is like\\nunto his; none would say that a younger man would speak so\\nlike an elder. Now look you, all the while that myself and\\ngoodly Odysseus were there, we never spake diversely either\\nin the assembly or in the council, but always were of one\\nmind, and advised the Argives with understanding and sound\\ncounsel, how all might be for the very best. But after we\\nhad sacked the steep city of Priam, and had departed in our\\nships, and a god had scattered the Achaeans, even then did\\nZeus devise in his heart a pitiful returning for the\\nArgives, for in no wise were they all discreet or just.\\nWherefore many of them met with an ill faring by reason of\\nthe deadly wrath of the grey-eyed goddess, the daughter of\\nthe mighty sire, who set debate between the two sons of\\nAtreus. And they twain called to the gathering of the host\\nall the Achaeans, recklessly and out of order, against the\\ngoing down of the sun; and lo, the sons of the Achaeans\\ncame heavy with wine. And the Atreidae spake out and told\\nthe reason wherefore they had assembled the host. Then\\nverily Menelaus charged all the Achaeans to bethink them of\\nreturning over the broad back of the sea, but in no sort\\ndid he please Agamemnon, whose desire was to keep back the\\nhost and to offer holy hecatombs, that so he might appease\\nthat dread wrath of Athene. Fool! for he knew not this,\\nthat she was never to be won; for the mind of the\\neverlasting gods is not lightly turned to repentance. So\\nthese twain stood bandying hard words; but the\\ngoodly-greaved Achaeans sprang up with a wondrous din, and\\ntwofold counsels found favour among them. So that one night\\nwe rested, thinking hard things against each other, for\\nZeus was fashioning for us a ruinous doom. But in the\\nmorning, we of the one part drew our ships to the fair salt\\nsea, and put aboard our wealth, and the low-girdled Trojan\\nwomen. Now one half the people abode steadfastly there with\\nAgamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the host; and half of\\nus embarked and drave to sea and swiftly the ships sailed,\\nfor a god made smooth the sea with the depths thereof. And\\nwhen we came to Tenedos, we did sacrifice to the gods,\\nbeing eager for the homeward way; but Zeus did not yet\\npurpose our returning, nay, hard was he, that roused once\\nmore an evil strife among us. Then some turned back their\\ncurved ships, and went their way, even the company of\\nOdysseus, the wise and manifold in counsel, once again\\nshowing a favour to Agamemnon, son of Atreus. But I fled on\\nwith the squadron that followed me, for I knew how now the\\ngod imagined mischief. And the warlike son of Tydeus fled\\nand roused his men thereto. And late in our track came\\nMenelaus of the fair hair, who found us in Lesbos,\\nconsidering about the long voyage, whether we should go\\nsea-ward of craggy Chios, by the isle of Psyria, keeping\\nthe isle upon our left, or inside Chios past windy Mimas.\\nSo we asked the god to show us a sign, and a sign he\\ndeclared to us, and bade us cleave a path across the middle\\nsea to Euboea, that we might flee the swiftest way from\\nsorrow. And a shrill wind arose and blew, and the ships ran\\nmost fleetly over the teeming ways, and in the night they\\ntouched at Geraestus. So there we sacrificed many thighs of\\nbulls to Poseidon, for joy that we had measured out so\\ngreat a stretch of sea. It was the fourth day when the\\ncompany of Diomede son of Tydeus, tamer of horses, moored\\ntheir gallant ships at Argos; but I held on for Pylos, and\\nthe breeze was never quenched from the hour that the god\\nsent it forth to blow. Even so I came, dear child, without\\ntidings, nor know I aught of those others, which of the\\nAchaeans were saved and which were lost. But all that I\\nhear tell of as I sit in our halls, thou shalt learn as it\\nis meet, and I will hide nothing from thee. Safely, they\\nsay, came the Myrmidons the wild spearsmen, whom the famous\\nson of high-souled Achilles led; and safely Philoctetes,\\nthe glorious son of Poias. And Idomeneus brought all his\\ncompany to Crete, all that escaped the war, and from him\\nthe sea gat none. And of the son of Atreus even yourselves\\nhave heard, far apart though ye dwell, how he came, and how\\nAegisthus devised his evil end; but verily he himself paid\\na terrible reckoning. So good a thing it is that a son of\\nthe dead should still be left, even as that son also took\\nvengeance on the slayer of his father, guileful Aegisthus,\\nwho slew his famous sire. And thou too, my friend, for I\\nsee thee very comely and tall, be valiant, that even men\\nunborn may praise thee.\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Telemachus answered him, and said: \\'Nestor, son of\\nNeleus, great glory of the Achaeans, verily and indeed he\\navenged himself, and the Achaeans shall noise his fame\\nabroad, that even those may hear who are yet for to be. Oh\\nthat the gods would clothe me with such strength as his,\\nthat I might take vengeance on the wooers for their cruel\\ntransgression, who wantonly devise against me infatuate\\ndeeds! But the gods have woven for me the web of no such\\nweal, for me or for my sire. But now I must in any wise\\nendure it.\\'\\n\\nThen Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, made answer:\\n\\'Dear friend, seeing thou dost call these things to my\\nremembrance and speak thereof, they tell me that many\\nwooers for thy mother\\'s hand plan mischief within the halls\\nin thy despite. Say, dost thou willingly submit thee to\\noppression, or do the people through the land hate thee,\\nobedient to the voice of a god? Who knows but that Odysseus\\nmay some day come and requite their violence, either\\nhimself alone or all the host of the Achaeans with him? Ah,\\nif but grey-eyed Athene were inclined to love thee, as once\\nshe cared exceedingly for the renowned Odysseus in the land\\nof the Trojans, where we Achaeans were sore afflicted, for\\nnever yet have I seen the gods show forth such manifest\\nlove, as then did Pallas Athene standing manifest by him,--\\nif she would be pleased so to love thee and to care for\\nthee, then might certain of them clean forget their\\nmarriage.\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Old man, in no\\nwise methinks shall this word be accomplished. This is a\\nhard saying of thine, awe comes over me. Not for my hopes\\nshall this thing come to pass, not even if the gods so\\nwilled it.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again:\\n\\'Telemachus, what word hath escaped the door of thy lips?\\nLightly might a god, if so he would, bring a man safe home\\neven from afar. Rather myself would I have travail and much\\npain ere I came home and saw the day of my returning, than\\ncome back and straightway perish on my own hearth-stone,\\neven as Agamemnon perished by guile at the hands of his own\\nwife and of Aegisthus. But lo you, death, which is common\\nto all, the very gods cannot avert even from the man they\\nlove, when the ruinous doom shall bring him low of death\\nthat lays men at their length.\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Telemachus answered her, saying: \\'Mentor, no\\nlonger let us tell of these things, sorrowful though we be.\\nThere is none assurance any more of his returning, but\\nalready have the deathless gods devised for him death and\\nblack fate. But now I would question Nestor, and ask him of\\nanother matter, as one who above all men knows judgments\\nand wisdom: for thrice, men say, he hath been king through\\nthe generations of men; yea, like an immortal he seems to\\nme to look upon. Nestor, son of Neleus, now tell me true:\\nhow died the son of Atreus, Agamemnon of the wide domain?\\nWhere was Menelaus? What death did crafty Aegisthus plan\\nfor him, in that he killed a man more valiant far than he?\\nOr was Menelaus not in Argos of Achaia but wandering\\nelsewhere among men, and that other took heart and slew\\nAgamemnon?\\'\\n\\nThen Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, answered him:\\n\\'Yea now, my child, I will tell thee the whole truth.\\nVerily thou guessest aright even of thyself how things\\nwould have fallen out, if Menelaus of the fair hair, the\\nson of Atreus, when he came back from Troy, had found\\nAegisthus yet alive in the halls. Then even in his death\\nwould they not have heaped the piled earth over him, but\\ndogs and fowls of the air would have devoured him as he lay\\non the plain far from the town. {*} Nor would any of the\\nAchaean women have bewailed him; so dread was the deed he\\ncontrived. Now we sat in leaguer there, achieving many\\nadventures; but he the while in peace in the heart of\\nArgos, the pastureland of horses, spake ofttimes, tempting\\nher, to the wife of Agamemnon. Verily at the first she\\nwould none of the foul deed, the fair Clytemnestra, for she\\nhad a good understanding. Moreover there was with her a\\nminstrel, whom the son of Atreus straitly charged as he\\nwent to Troy to have a care of his wife. But when at last\\nthe doom of the gods bound her to her ruin, then did\\nAegisthus carry the minstrel to a lonely isle, and left him\\nthere to be the prey and spoil of birds; while as for her,\\nhe led her to his house, a willing lover with a willing\\nlady. And he burnt many thigh slices upon the holy altars\\nof the gods, and hung up many offerings, woven-work and\\ngold, seeing that he had accomplished a great deed, beyond\\nall hope. Now we, I say, were sailing together on our way\\nfrom Troy, the son of Atreus and I, as loving friends. But\\nwhen we had reached holy Sunium, the headland of Athens,\\nthere Phoebus Apollo slew the pilot of Menelaus with the\\nvisitation of his gentle shafts, as he held between his\\nhands the rudder of the running ship, even Phrontis, son of\\nOnetor, who excelled the tribes of men in piloting a ship,\\nwhenso the storm-winds were hurrying by. Thus was Menelaus\\nholden there, though eager for the way, till he might bury\\nhis friend and pay the last rites over him. But when he in\\nhis turn, faring over the wine-dark sea in hollow ships,\\nreached in swift course the steep mount of Malea, then it\\nwas that Zeus of the far-borne voice devised a hateful\\npath, and shed upon them the breath of the shrill winds,\\nand great swelling waves arose like unto mountains. There\\nsundered he the fleet in twain, and part thereof he brought\\nnigh to Crete, where the Cydonians dwelt about the streams\\nof Iardanus. Now there is a certain cliff, smooth and sheer\\ntowards the sea, on the border of Gortyn, in the misty\\ndeep, where the South-West Wind drives a great wave against\\nthe left headland, towards Phaestus, and a little rock\\nkeeps back the mighty water. Thither came one part of the\\nfleet, and the men scarce escaped destruction, but the\\nships were broken by the waves against the rock; while\\nthose other five dark-prowed ships the wind and the water\\nbare and brought nigh to Egypt. Thus Menelaus, gathering\\nmuch livelihood and gold, was wandering there with his\\nships among men of strange speech, and even then Aegisthus\\nplanned that pitiful work at home. And for seven years he\\nruled over Mycenae, rich in gold, after he slew the son of\\nAtreus, and the people were subdued unto him. But in the\\neighth year came upon him goodly Orestes back from Athens\\nto be his bane, and slew the slayer of his father, guileful\\nAegisthus, who killed his famous sire. Now when he had\\nslain him, he made a funeral feast to the Argives over his\\nhateful mother, and over the craven Aegisthus. And on the\\nselfsame day there came to him Menelaus of the loud\\nwar-cry, bringing much treasure, even all the freight of\\nhis ships. So thou, my friend, wander not long far away\\nfrom home, leaving thy substance behind thee and men in thy\\nhouse so wanton, lest they divide and utterly devour all\\nthy wealth, and thou shalt have gone on a vain journey.\\nRather I bid and command thee to go to Menelaus, for he\\nhath lately come from a strange country, from the land of\\nmen whence none would hope in his heart to return, whom\\nonce the storms have driven wandering into so wide a sea.\\nThence not even the birds can make their way in the space\\nof one year, so great a sea it is and terrible. But go now\\nwith thy ship and with thy company, or if thou hast a mind\\nto fare by land, I have a chariot and horses at thy\\nservice, yea and my sons to do thy will, who will be thy\\nguides to goodly Lacedaemon, where is Menelaus of the fair\\nhair. Do thou thyself entreat him, that he may give thee\\nunerring answer. He will not lie to thee, for he is very\\nwise.\\'\\n\\n{* Reading [Greek]. v. 1. \\'[Greek], which must be wrong.}\\n\\nThus he spake, and the sun went down and darkness came on.\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake among them,\\nsaying: \\'Yea, old man, thou hast told all this thy tale\\naright. But come, cut up the tongues of the victims and mix\\nthe wine, that we may pour forth before Poseidon and the\\nother deathless gods, and so may bethink us of sleep, for\\nit is the hour for sleep. For already has the light gone\\nbeneath the west, and it is not seemly to sit long at a\\nbanquet of the gods, but to be going home.\\'\\n\\nSo spake the daughter of Zeus, and they hearkened to her\\nvoice. And the henchmen poured water over their hands, and\\npages crowned the mixing bowls with drink, and served out\\nthe wine to all, after they had first poured for libation\\ninto each cup in turn; and they cast the tongues upon the\\nfire, and stood up and poured the drink-offering thereon.\\nBut when they had poured forth and had drunken to their\\nheart\\'s content, Athene and godlike Telemachus were both\\nset on returning to the hollow ship; but Nestor would have\\nstayed them, and accosted them, saying: \\'Zeus forfend it,\\nand all the other deathless gods, that ye should depart\\nfrom my house to the swift ship, as from the dwelling of\\none that is utterly without raiment or a needy man, who\\nhath not rugs or blankets many in his house whereon to\\nsleep softly, he or his guests. Nay not so, I have rugs and\\nfair blankets by me. Never, methinks, shall the dear son of\\nthis man, even of Odysseus, lay him down upon the ship\\'s\\ndeck, while as yet I am alive, and my children after me are\\nleft in my hall to entertain strangers, whoso may chance to\\ncome to my house.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again:\\n\\'Yea, herein hast thou spoken aright, dear father: and\\nTelemachus may well obey thee, for before all things this\\nis meet. Behold, he shall now depart with thee, that he may\\nsleep in thy halls; as for me I will go to the black ship,\\nthat I may cheer my company and tell them all. For I avow\\nme to be the one elder among them; those others are but\\nyounger men, who follow for love of him, all of them of\\nlike age with the high-souled Telemachus. There will I lay\\nme down by the black hollow ship this night; but in the\\nmorning I will go to the Cauconians high of heart, where\\nsomewhat of mine is owing to me, no small debt nor of\\nyesterday. But do thou send this man upon his way with thy\\nchariot and thy son, since he hath come to thy house, and\\ngive him horses the lightest of foot and chief in\\nstrength.\\'\\n\\nTherewith grey-eyed Athene departed in the semblance of a\\nsea-eagle; and amazement fell on all that saw it, and the\\nold man he marvelled when his eyes beheld it. And he took\\nthe hand of Telemachus and spake and hailed him:\\n\\n\\'My friend, methinks that thou wilt in no sort be a coward\\nand a weakling, if indeed in thy youth the gods thus follow\\nwith thee to be thy guides. For truly this is none other of\\nthose who keep the mansions of Olympus, save only the\\ndaughter of Zeus, the driver of the spoil, the maiden\\nTrito-born, she that honoured thy good father too among the\\nArgives. Nay be gracious, queen, and vouchsafe a goodly\\nfame to me, even to me and to my sons and to my wife\\nrevered. And I in turn will sacrifice to thee a yearling\\nheifer, broad of brow, unbroken, which man never yet hath\\nled beneath the yoke. Such an one will I offer to thee, and\\ngild her horns with gold.\\'\\n\\nEven so he spake in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him.\\nThen Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, led them, even\\nhis sons and the husbands of his daughters, to his own fair\\nhouse. But when they had reached this prince\\'s famous\\nhalls, they sat down all orderly on seats and high chairs;\\nand when they were come, the old man mixed well for them a\\nbowl of sweet wine, which now in the eleventh year from the\\nvintaging the housewife opened, and unloosed the string\\nthat fastened the lid. The old man let mix a bowl thereof,\\nand prayed instantly to Athene as he poured forth before\\nher, even to the daughter of Zeus, lord of the aegis.\\n\\nBut after they had poured forth and had drunken to their\\nheart\\'s content, these went each one to his own house to\\nlie down to rest. But Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots,\\nwould needs have Telemachus, son of divine Odysseus, to\\nsleep there on a jointed bedstead beneath the echoing\\ngallery, and by him Peisistratus of the good ashen spear,\\nleader of men, who alone of his sons was yet unwed in his\\nhalls. As for him he slept within the inmost chamber of the\\nlofty house, and the lady his wife arrayed for him bedstead\\nand bedding.\\n\\nSo soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,\\nNestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, gat him up from his\\nbed, and he went forth and sat him down upon the smooth\\nstones, which were before his lofty doors, all polished,\\nwhite and glistening, whereon Neleus sat of old, in counsel\\nthe peer of the gods. Howbeit, stricken by fate, he had ere\\nnow gone down to the house of Hades, and to-day Nestor of\\nGerenia in his turn sat thereon, warder of the Achaeans,\\nwith his staff in his hands. And about him his sons were\\ngathered and come together, issuing from their chambers,\\nEchephron and Stratius, and Perseus and Aretus and the\\ngodlike Thrasymedes. And sixth and last came the hero\\nPeisistratus. And they led godlike Telemachus and set him\\nby their side, and Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots,\\nspake first among them:\\n\\n\\'Quickly, my dear children, accomplish my desire, that\\nfirst of all the gods I may propitiate Athene, who came to\\nme in visible presence to the rich feast of the god. Nay\\nthen, let one go to the plain for a heifer, that she may\\ncome as soon as may be, and that the neat-herd may drive\\nher: and let another go to the black ship of high-souled\\nTelemachus to bring all his company, and let him leave two\\nmen only. And let one again bid Laerces the goldsmith to\\ncome hither that he may gild the horns of the heifer. And\\nye others, abide ye here together and speak to the\\nhandmaids within that they make ready a banquet through our\\nfamous halls, and fetch seats and logs to set about the\\naltar, and bring clear water.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake and lo, they all hastened to the work. The\\nheifer she came from the field, and from the swift gallant\\nship came the company of great-hearted Telemachus; the\\nsmith came holding in his hands his tools, the instruments\\nof his craft, anvil and hammer and well-made pincers,\\nwherewith he wrought the gold; Athene too came to receive\\nher sacrifice. And the old knight Nestor gave gold, and the\\nother fashioned it skilfully, and gilded therewith the\\nhorns of the heifer, that the goddess might be glad at the\\nsight of her fair offering. And Stratius and goodly\\nEchephron led the heifer by the horns. And Aretus came\\nforth from the chamber bearing water for the washing of\\nhands in a basin of flowered work, and in the other hand he\\nheld the barley-meal in a basket; and Thrasymedes,\\nsteadfast in the battle, stood by holding in his hand a\\nsharp axe, ready to smite the heifer. And Perseus held the\\ndish for the blood, and the old man Nestor, driver of\\nchariots, performed the first rite of the washing of hands\\nand the sprinkling of the meal, and he prayed instantly to\\nAthene as he began the rite, casting into the fire the lock\\nfrom the head of the victim.\\n\\nNow when they had prayed and tossed the sprinkled grain,\\nstraightway the son of Nestor, gallant Thrasymedes, stood\\nby and struck the blow; and the axe severed the tendons of\\nthe neck and loosened the might of the heifer; and the\\nwomen raised their cry, the daughters and the sons\\' wives\\nand the wife revered of Nestor, Eurydice, eldest of the\\ndaughters of Clymenus. And now they lifted the victim\\'s\\nhead from the wide-wayed earth, and held it so, while\\nPeisistratus, leader of men, cut the throat. And after the\\nblack blood had gushed forth and the life had left the\\nbones, quickly they broke up the body, and anon cut slices\\nfrom the thighs all duly, and wrapt the same in the fat,\\nfolding them double, and laid raw flesh thereon. So that\\nold man burnt them on the cleft wood, and poured over them\\nthe red wine, and by his side the young men held in their\\nhands the five-pronged forks. Now after that the thighs\\nwere quite consumed and they had tasted the inner parts,\\nthey cut the rest up small and spitted and roasted it,\\nholding the sharp spits in their hands.\\n\\nMeanwhile she bathed Telemachus, even fair Polycaste, the\\nyoungest daughter of Nestor, son of Neleus. And after she\\nhad bathed him and anointed him with olive oil, and cast\\nabout him a goodly mantle and a doublet, he came forth from\\nthe bath in fashion like the deathless gods. So he went and\\nsat him down by Nestor, shepherd of the people.\\n\\nNow when they had roasted the outer flesh, and drawn it off\\nthe spits, they sat down and fell to feasting, and\\nhonourable men waited on them, pouring wine into the golden\\ncups. But when they had put from them the desire of meat\\nand drink, Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, first spake\\namong them:\\n\\n\\'Lo now, my sons, yoke for Telemachus horses with flowing\\nmane and lead them beneath the car, that he may get forward\\non his way.\\'\\n\\nEven so he spake, and they gave good heed and hearkened;\\nand quickly they yoked the swift horses beneath the\\nchariot. And the dame that kept the stores placed therein\\ncorn and wine and dainties, such as princes eat, the\\nfosterlings of Zeus. So Telemachus stept up into the goodly\\ncar, and with him Peisistratus son of Nestor, leader of\\nmen, likewise climbed the car and grasped the reins in his\\nhands, and he touched the horses with the whip to start\\nthem, and nothing loth the pair flew towards the plain, and\\nleft the steep citadel of Pylos. So all day long they\\nswayed the yoke they bore upon their necks.\\n\\nNow the sun sank and all the ways were darkened. And they\\ncame to Pherae, to the house of Diocles, son of Orsilochus,\\nthe child begotten of Alpheus. There they rested for the\\nnight, and by them he set the entertainment of strangers.\\n\\nNow so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,\\nthey yoked the horses and mounted the inlaid car. And forth\\nthey drave from the gateway and the echoing gallery, and\\nPeisistratus touched the horses with the whip to start\\nthem, and the pair flew onward nothing loth. So they came\\nto the wheat-bearing plain, and thenceforth they pressed\\ntoward the end: in such wise did the swift horses speed\\nforward. Now the sun sank and all the ways were darkened.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook IV\\n\\n  Telemachus\\' entertainment at Sparta, where Menelaus tells\\n  him what befell many of the Greeks on their return; that\\n  Odysseus was with Calypso in the isle Ogygia, as he was\\n  told by Proteus.\\n\\nAnd they came to Lacedaemon lying low among the caverned\\nhills, and drave to the dwelling of renowned Menelaus. Him\\nthey found giving a feast in his house to many friends of\\nhis kin, a feast for the wedding of his noble son and\\ndaughter. His daughter he was sending to the son of\\nAchilles, cleaver of the ranks of men, for in Troy he first\\nhad promised and covenanted to give her, and now the gods\\nwere bringing about their marriage. So now he was speeding\\nher on her way with chariot and horses, to the famous city\\nof the Myrmidons, among whom her lord bare rule. And for\\nhis son he was bringing to his home the daughter of Alector\\nout of Sparta, for his well-beloved son, strong\\nMegapenthes, {*} born of a slave woman, for the gods no\\nmore showed promise of seed to Helen, from the day that she\\nbare a lovely child, Hermione, as fair as golden Aphrodite.\\nSo they were feasting through the great vaulted hall, the\\nneighbours and the kinsmen of renowned Menelaus, making\\nmerry; and among them a divine minstrel was singing to the\\nlyre, and as he began the song two tumblers in the company\\nwhirled through the midst of them.\\n\\n{* A son of sorrow: Tristram.}\\n\\nMeanwhile those twain, the hero Telemachus and the splendid\\nson of Nestor, made halt at the entry of the gate, they and\\ntheir horses. And the lord Eteoneus came forth and saw\\nthem, the ready squire of renowned Menelaus; and he went\\nthrough the palace to bear the tidings to the shepherd of\\nthe people, and standing near spake to him winged words:\\n\\n\\'Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, here are two strangers,\\nwhosoever they be, two men like to the lineage of great\\nZeus. Say, shall we loose their swift horses from under the\\nyoke, or send them onward to some other host who shall\\nreceive them kindly?\\'\\n\\nThen in sore displeasure spake to him Menelaus of the fair\\nhair: \\'Eteoneus son of Boethous, truly thou wert not a fool\\naforetime, but now for this once, like a child thou talkest\\nfolly. Surely ourselves ate much hospitable cheer of other\\nmen, ere we twain came hither, even if in time to come Zeus\\nhaply give us rest from affliction. Nay go, unyoke the\\nhorses of the strangers, and as for the men, lead them\\nforward to the house to feast with us.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and Eteoneus hasted from the hall, and called\\nthe other ready squires to follow with him. So they loosed\\nthe sweating horses from beneath the yoke, and fastened\\nthem at the stalls of the horses, and threw beside them\\nspelt, and therewith mixed white barley, and tilted the\\nchariot against the shining faces of the gateway, and led\\nthe men into the hall divine. And they beheld and marvelled\\nas they gazed throughout the palace of the king, the\\nfosterling of Zeus; for there was a gleam as it were of sun\\nor moon through the lofty palace of renowned Menelaus. But\\nafter they had gazed their fill, they went to the polished\\nbaths and bathed them. Now when the maidens had bathed them\\nand anointed them with olive oil, and cast about them thick\\ncloaks and doublets, they sat on chairs by Menelaus, son of\\nAtreus. And a handmaid bare water for the hands in a goodly\\ngolden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin to\\nwash withal; and to their side she drew a polished table,\\nand a grave dame bare food and set it by them, and laid\\nupon the board many dainties, giving freely of such things\\nas she had by her, and a carver lifted and placed by them\\nplatters of divers kinds of flesh, and nigh them he set\\ngolden bowls. So Menelaus of the fair hair greeted the\\ntwain and spake:\\n\\n\\'Taste ye food and be glad, and thereafter when ye have\\nsupped, we will ask what men ye are; for the blood of your\\nparents is not lost in you, but ye are of the line of men\\nthat are sceptred kings, the fosterlings of Zeus; for no\\nchurls could beget sons like you.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and took and set before them the fat ox-chine\\nroasted, which they had given him as his own mess by way of\\nhonour. And they stretched forth their hands upon the good\\ncheer set before them. Now when they had put from them the\\ndesire of meat and drink Telemachus spake to the son of\\nNestor, holding his head close to him, that those others\\nmight not hear:\\n\\n\\'Son of Nestor, delight of my heart, mark the flashing of\\nbronze through the echoing halls, and the flashing of gold\\nand of amber and of silver and of ivory. Such like,\\nmethinks, is the court of Olympian Zeus within, for the\\nworld of things that are here; wonder comes over me as I\\nlook thereon.\\'\\n\\nAnd as he spake Menelaus of the fair hair was ware of him,\\nand uttering his voice spake to them winged words:\\n\\n\\'Children dear, of a truth no one of mortal men may contend\\nwith Zeus, for his mansions and his treasures are\\neverlasting: but of men there may be who will vie with me\\nin treasure, or there may be none. Yea, for after many a\\nwoe and wanderings manifold, I brought my wealth home in\\nships, and in the eighth year came hither. I roamed over\\nCyprus and Phoenicia and Egypt, and reached the Aethiopians\\nand Sidonians and Erembi and Libya, where lambs are horned\\nfrom the birth. For there the ewes yean thrice within the\\nfull circle of a year; there neither lord nor shepherd\\nlacketh aught of cheese or flesh or of sweet milk, but ever\\nthe flocks yield store of milk continual. While I was yet\\nroaming in those lands, gathering much livelihood, meantime\\nanother slew my brother privily, at unawares, by the guile\\nof his accursed wife. Thus, look you, I have no joy of my\\nlordship among these my possessions: and ye are like to\\nhave heard hereof from your fathers, whosoever they be, for\\nI have suffered much and let a house go to ruin that was\\nstablished fair, and had in it much choice substance. I\\nwould that I had but a third part of those my riches, and\\ndwelt in my halls, and that those men were yet safe, who\\nperished of old in the wide land of Troy, far from Argos,\\nthe pastureland of horses. Howbeit, though I bewail them\\nall and sorrow oftentimes as I sit in our halls,--awhile\\nindeed I satisfy my soul with lamentation, and then again I\\ncease; for soon hath man enough of chill lamentation--yet\\nfor them all I make no such dole, despite my grief, as for\\none only, who causes me to loathe both sleep and meat, when\\nI think upon him. For no one of the Achaeans toiled so\\ngreatly as Odysseus toiled and adventured himself: but to\\nhim it was to be but labour and trouble, and to me grief\\never comfortless for his sake, so long he is afar, nor know\\nwe aught, whether he be alive or dead. Yea methinks they\\nlament him, even that old Laertes and the constant Penelope\\nand Telemachus, whom he left a child new-born in his\\nhouse.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and in the heart of Telemachus he stirred a\\nyearning to lament his father; and at his father\\'s name he\\nlet a tear fall from his eyelids to the ground, and held up\\nhis purple mantle with both his hands before his eyes. And\\nMenelaus marked him and mused in his mind and his heart\\nwhether he should leave him to speak of his father, or\\nfirst question him and prove him in every word.\\n\\nWhile yet he pondered these things in his mind and in his\\nheart, Helen came forth from her fragrant vaulted chamber,\\nlike Artemis of the golden arrows; and with her came\\nAdraste and set for her the well-wrought chair, and Alcippe\\nbare a rug of soft wool, and Phylo bare a silver basket\\nwhich Alcandre gave her, the wife of Polybus, who dwelt in\\nThebes of Egypt, where is the chiefest store of wealth in\\nthe houses. He gave two silver baths to Menelaus, and\\ntripods twain, ad ten talents of gold. And besides all\\nthis, his wife bestowed on Helen lovely gifts; a golden\\ndistaff did she give, and a silver basket with wheels\\nbeneath, and the rims thereof were finished with gold. This\\nit was that the handmaid Phylo bare and set beside her,\\nfilled with dressed yarn, and across it was laid a distaff\\ncharged with wool of violet blue. So Helen sat her down in\\nthe chair, and beneath was a footstool for the feet. And\\nanon she spake to her lord and questioned him of each\\nthing:\\n\\n\\'Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, know we now who these men\\navow themselves to be that have come under our roof? Shall\\nI dissemble or shall I speak the truth? Nay, I am minded to\\ntell it. None, I say, have I ever yet seen so like another,\\nman or woman--wonder comes over me as I look on him--as\\nthis man is like the son of great-hearted Odysseus,\\nTelemachus, whom he left a new born child in his house,\\nwhen for the sake of me, shameless woman that I was, ye\\nAchaeans came up under Troy with bold war in your hearts.\\'\\n\\nAnd Menelaus of the fair hair answered her, saying: \\'Now I\\ntoo, lady, mark the likeness even as thou tracest it. For\\nsuch as these were his feet, such his hands, and the\\nglances of his eyes, and his head, and his hair withal.\\nYea, and even now I was speaking of Odysseus, as I\\nremembered him, of all his woeful travail for my sake;\\nwhen, lo, he let fall a bitter tear beneath his brows, and\\nheld his purple cloak up before his eyes.\\'\\n\\nAnd Peisistratus, son of Nestor, answered him, saying:\\n\\'Menelaus, son of Atreus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the\\nhost, assuredly this is the son of that very man, even as\\nthou sayest. But he is of a sober wit, and thinketh it\\nshame in his heart as on this his first coming to make show\\nof presumptuous words in the presence of thee, in whose\\nvoice we twain delight as in the voice of a god. Now Nestor\\nof Gerenia, lord of chariots, sent me forth to be his guide\\non the way: for he desired to see thee that thou mightest\\nput into his heart some word or work. For a son hath many\\ngriefs in his halls when his father is away, if perchance\\nhe hath none to stand by him. Even so it is now with\\nTelemachus; his father is away, nor hath he others in the\\ntownship to defend him from distress.\\'\\n\\nAnd Menelaus of the fair hair answered him, and said: \\'Lo\\nnow, in good truth there has come unto my house the son of\\na friend indeed, who for my sake endured many adventures.\\nAnd I thought to welcome him on his coming more nobly than\\nall the other Argives, if but Olympian Zeus, of the\\nfar-borne voice, had vouchsafed us a return over the sea in\\nour swift ships,--that such a thing should be. And in Argos\\nI would have given him a city to dwell in, and stablished\\nfor him a house, and brought him forth from Ithaca with his\\nsubstance and his son and all his people, making one city\\ndesolate of those that lie around, and are in mine own\\ndomain. Then ofttimes would we have held converse here, and\\nnought would have parted us, the welcoming and the\\nwelcomed, {*} ere the black cloud of death overshadowed us.\\nHowsoever, the god himself, methinks, must have been\\njealous hereof, who from that hapless man alone cut off his\\nreturning.\\'\\n\\n{* Mr. Evelyn Abbott of Balliol College has suggested to us\\nthat [Greek] and [Greek] are here correlatives, and denote\\nrespectively the parts of host and of guest. This is\\nsufficiently borne out by the usage of the words\\nelsewhere.}\\n\\nSo spake he, and in the hearts of all he stirred the desire\\nof lamentation. She wept, even Argive Helen the daughter of\\nZeus, and Telemachus wept, and Menelaus the son of Atreus;\\nnay, nor did the son of Nestor keep tearless eyes. For he\\nbethought him in his heart of noble Antilochus, whom the\\nglorious son of the bright Dawn had slain. Thinking upon\\nhim he spake winged words:\\n\\n\\'Son of Atreus, the ancient Nestor in his own halls was\\never wont to say that thou wert wise beyond man\\'s wisdom,\\nwhensoever we made mention of thee and asked one another\\nconcerning thee. And now, if it be possible, be persuaded\\nby me, who for one have no pleasure in weeping at supper\\ntime--the new-born day will right soon be upon us. {*} Not\\nindeed that I deem it blame at all to weep for any mortal\\nwho hath died and met his fate. Lo, this is now the only\\ndue we pay to miserable men, to cut the hair and let the\\ntear fall from the cheek. For I too have a brother dead,\\nnowise the meanest of the Argives, and thou art like to\\nhave known him, for as for me I never encountered him,\\nnever beheld him. But men say that Antilochus outdid all,\\nbeing excellent in speed of foot and in the fight.\\'\\n\\n{* Cf. B. xv.50}\\n\\nAnd Menelaus of the fair hair answered him, and said: \\'My\\nfriend, lo, thou hast said all that a wise man might say or\\ndo, yea, and an elder than thou;--for from such a sire too\\nthou art sprung, wherefore thou dost even speak wisely.\\nRight easily known is that man\\'s seed, for whom Cronion\\nweaves the skein of luck at bridal and at birth: even as\\nnow hath he granted prosperity to Nestor for ever for all\\nhis days, that he himself should grow into a smooth old age\\nin his halls, and his sons moreover should be wise and the\\nbest of spearsmen. But we will cease now the weeping which\\nwas erewhile made, and let us once more bethink us of our\\nsupper, and let them pour water over our hands. And again\\nin the morning there will be tales for Telemachus and me to\\ntell one to the other, even to the end.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and Asphalion poured water over their hands,\\nthe ready squire of renowned Menelaus. And they put forth\\ntheir hands upon the good cheer spread before them.\\n\\nThen Helen, daughter of Zeus, turned to new thoughts.\\nPresently she cast a drug into the wine whereof they drank,\\na drug to lull all pain and anger, and bring forgetfulness\\nof every sorrow. Whoso should drink a draught thereof, when\\nit is mingled in the bowl, on that day he would let no tear\\nfall down his cheeks, not though his mother and his father\\ndied, not though men slew his brother or dear son with the\\nsword before his face, and his own eyes beheld it.\\nMedicines of such virtue and so helpful had the daughter of\\nZeus, which Polydamna, the wife of Thon, had given her, a\\nwoman of Egypt, where earth the grain-giver yields herbs in\\ngreatest plenty, many that are healing in the cup, and many\\nbaneful. There each man is a leech skilled beyond all human\\nkind; yea, for they are of the race of Paeeon. Now after\\nshe had cast in the drug and bidden pour forth of the wine,\\nshe made answer once again, and spake unto her lord:\\n\\n\\'Son of Atreus, Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, and lo, ye\\nsons of noble men, forasmuch as now to one and now to\\nanother Zeus gives good and evil, for to him all things are\\npossible,--now, verily, sit ye down and feast in the halls,\\nand take ye joy in the telling of tales, and I will tell\\nyou one that fits the time. Now all of them I could not\\ntell or number, so many as were the adventures of Odysseus\\nof the hardy heart; but, ah, what a deed was this he\\nwrought and dared in his hardiness in the land of the\\nTrojans, where ye Achaeans suffered affliction. He subdued\\nhis body with unseemly stripes, and a sorry covering he\\ncast about his shoulders, and in the fashion of a servant\\nhe went down into the wide-wayed city of the foemen, and he\\nhid himself in the guise of another, a beggar, though in no\\nwise such an one was he at the ships of the Achaeans. In\\nthis semblance he passed into the city of the Trojans, and\\nthey wist not who he was, and I alone knew him in that\\nguise, and I kept questioning him, but in his subtlety he\\navoided me. But when at last I was about washing him and\\nanointing him with olive oil, and had put on him raiment,\\nand sworn a great oath not to reveal Odysseus amid the\\nTrojans, ere he reached the swift ships and the huts, even\\nthen he told me all the purpose of the Achaeans. And after\\nslaying many of the Trojans with the long sword, he\\nreturned to the Argives and brought back word again of all.\\nThen the other Trojan women wept aloud, but my soul was\\nglad, for already my heart was turned to go back again even\\nto my home: and now at the last I groaned for the blindness\\nthat Aphrodite gave me, when she led me thither away from\\nmine own country, forsaking my child and my bridal chamber\\nand my lord, that lacked not aught whether for wisdom or\\nyet for beauty.\\'\\n\\nAnd Menelaus of the fair hair answered her, saying: \\'Verily\\nall this tale, lady, thou hast duly told. Ere now have I\\nlearned the counsel and the thought of many heroes, and\\ntravelled over many a land, but never yet have mine eyes\\nbeheld any such man of heart as was Odysseus; such another\\ndeed as he wrought and dared in his hardiness even in the\\nshapen horse, wherein sat all we chiefs of the Argives,\\nbearing to the Trojans death and doom. Anon thou camest\\nthither, and sure some god must have bidden thee, who\\nwished to bring glory to the Trojans. Yea and godlike\\nDeiphobus went with thee on thy way. Thrice thou didst go\\nround about the hollow ambush and handle it, calling aloud\\non the chiefs of the Argives by name, and making thy voice\\nlike the voices of the wives of all the Argives. Now I and\\nthe son of Tydeus and goodly Odysseus sat in the midst and\\nheard thy call; and verily we twain had a desire to start\\nup and come forth or presently to answer from within; but\\nOdysseus stayed and held us there, despite our eagerness.\\nThen all the other sons of the Achaeans held their peace,\\nbut Anticlus alone was still minded to answer thee. Howbeit\\nOdysseus firmly closed his mouth with strong hands, and so\\nsaved all the Achaeans, and held him until such time as\\nPallas Athene led thee back.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, and said: \\'Menelaus, son\\nof Atreus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the host, all the\\nmore grievous it is! for in no way did this courage ward\\nfrom him pitiful destruction, not though his heart within\\nhim had been very iron. But come, bid us to bed, that\\nforthwith we may take our joy of rest beneath the spell of\\nsleep.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and Argive Helen bade her handmaids set out\\nbedsteads beneath the gallery, and fling on them fair\\npurple blankets and spread coverlets above, and thereon lay\\nthick mantles to be a clothing over all. So they went from\\nthe hall with torch in hand, and spread the beds, and the\\nhenchman led forth the guests. Thus they slept there in the\\nvestibule of the house, the hero Telemachus and the\\nsplendid son of Nestor. But the son of Atreus slept, as his\\ncustom was, in the inmost chamber of the lofty house, and\\nby him lay long-robed Helen, that fair lady.\\n\\nSoon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, Menelaus\\nof the loud war-shout gat him up from his bed and put on\\nhis raiment, and cast his sharp sword about his shoulder,\\nand beneath his smooth feet bound his goodly sandals, and\\nstept forth from his chamber, in presence like a god, and\\nsat by Telemachus, and spake and hailed him:\\n\\n\\'To what end hath thy need brought thee hither, hero\\nTelemachus, unto fair Lacedaemon, over the broad back of\\nthe sea? Is it a matter of the common weal or of thine own?\\nHerein tell me the plain truth.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, and said: \\'Menelaus, son\\nof Atreus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the host, I have\\ncome if perchance thou mayest tell me some tidings of my\\nfather. My dwelling is being devoured and my fat lands are\\nruined, and of unfriendly men my house is full,--who\\nslaughter continually my thronging flocks, and my kine with\\ntrailing feet and shambling gait,--none other than the\\nwooers of my mother, despiteful out of measure. So now am I\\ncome hither to thy knees, if haply thou art willing to tell\\nme of his pitiful death, as one that saw it perchance with\\nthine own eyes, or heard the story from some other\\nwanderer; for his mother bare him to exceeding sorrow. And\\nspeak me no soft words in ruth or pity, but tell me plainly\\nhow thou didst get sight of him. Ah, I pray thee, if ever\\nat all my father, good Odysseus, made promise to thee of\\nword or work and fulfilled the same in the land of the\\nTrojans, where ye Achaeans suffered affliction, these\\nthings, I pray thee, now remember and tell me truth.\\'\\n\\nThen in heavy displeasure spake to him Menelaus of the fair\\nhair: \\'Out upon them, for truly in the bed of a\\nbrave-hearted man were they minded to lie, very cravens as\\nthey are! Even as when a hind hath couched her newborn\\nfawns unweaned in a strong lion\\'s lair, and searcheth out\\nthe mountain knees and grassy hollows, seeking pasture, and\\nafterward the lion cometh back to his bed, and sendeth\\nforth unsightly death upon that pair, even so shall\\nOdysseus send forth unsightly death upon the wooers. Would\\nto our father Zeus and Athene and Apollo, would that in\\nsuch might as when of old in stablished Lesbos he rose up\\nand wrestled a match with Philomeleides and threw him\\nmightily, and all the Achaeans rejoiced; would that in such\\nstrength Odysseus might consort with the wooers: then\\nshould they all have swift fate, and bitter wedlock! But\\nfor that whereof thou askest and entreatest me, be sure I\\nwill not swerve from the truth in aught that I say, nor\\ndeceive thee; but of all that the ancient one of the sea,\\nwhose speech is sooth, declared to me, not a word will I\\nhide or keep from thee.\\n\\n\\'In the river Aegyptus, {*} though eager I was to press\\nonward home, the gods they stayed me, for that I had not\\noffered them the acceptable sacrifice of hecatombs, and the\\ngods ever desired that men should be mindful of their\\ncommandments. Now there is an island in the wash of the\\nwaves over against Aegyptus, and men call it Pharos, within\\none day\\'s voyage of a hollow ship, when shrill winds blow\\nfair in her wake. And therein is a good haven, whence men\\nlaunch the gallant ships into the deep when they have drawn\\na store of deep black water. There the gods held me twenty\\ndays, nor did the sea-winds ever show their breath, they\\nthat serve to waft ships over the broad back of the sea.\\nAnd now would all our corn have been spent, and likewise\\nthe strength of the men, except some goddess had taken pity\\non me and saved me, Eidothee, daughter of mighty Proteus,\\nthe ancient one of the sea. For most of all I moved her\\nheart, when she met me wandering alone apart from my\\ncompany, who were ever roaming round the isle, fishing with\\nbent hooks, for hunger was gnawing at their belly. So she\\nstood by, and spake and uttered her voice saying:\\n\\n{* The only name for the Nile in Homer. Cf. Wilkinson,\\nAncient Egyptians (1878), vol. i. p. 7.}\\n\\n\\'\"Art thou so very foolish, stranger, and feeble-witted, or\\nart thou wilfully remiss, and hast pleasure in suffering?\\nSo long time art thou holden in the isle and canst find no\\nissue therefrom, while the heart of thy company faileth\\nwithin them?\"\\n\\n\\'Even so she spake, and I answered her saying: \"I will\\nspeak forth, what goddess soever thou art, and tell thee\\nthat in no wise am I holden here by mine own will, but it\\nneeds must be that I have sinned against the deathless\\ngods, who keep the wide heaven. Howbeit, do thou tell\\nme--for the gods know all things--which of the immortals it\\nis that binds me here and hath hindered me from my way, and\\ndeclare as touching my returning how I may go over the\\nteeming deep.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and straightway the fair goddess made answer:\\n\"Yea now, sir, I will plainly tell thee all. Hither\\nresorteth that ancient one of the sea, whose speech is\\nsooth, the deathless Egyptian Proteus, who knows the depths\\nof every sea, and is the thrall of Poseidon, and who, they\\nsay, is my father that begat me. If thou couldst but lay an\\nambush and catch him, he will surely declare to thee the\\nway and the measure of thy path, and will tell thee of thy\\nreturning, how thou mayest go over the teeming deep. Yea,\\nand he will show thee, O fosterling of Zeus, if thou wilt,\\nwhat good thing and what evil hath been wrought in thy\\nhalls, whilst thou has been faring this long and grievous\\nway.\"\\n\\n\\'So she spake, but I answered and said unto her: \"Devise\\nnow thyself the ambush to take this ancient one divine,\\nlest by any chance he see me first, or know of my coming,\\nand avoid me. For a god is hard for mortal man to quell.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and straightway the fair goddess made answer:\\n\"Yea now, sir, I will plainly tell thee all. So often as\\nthe sun in his course stands high in mid heaven, then forth\\nfrom the brine comes the ancient one of the sea, whose\\nspeech is sooth, before the breath of the West Wind he\\ncomes, and the sea\\'s dark ripple covers him. And when he is\\ngot forth, he lies down to sleep in the hollow of the\\ncaves. And around him the seals, the brood of the fair\\ndaughter of the brine, sleep all in a flock, stolen forth\\nfrom the grey sea water, and bitter is the scent they\\nbreathe of the deeps of the salt sea. There will I lead\\nthee at the breaking of the day, and couch you all orderly;\\nso do thou choose diligently three of thy company, the best\\nthou hast in thy decked ships. And I will tell thee all the\\nmagic arts of that old man. First, he will number the seals\\nand go over them; but when he has told their tale and\\nbeheld them, he will lay him down in the midst, as a\\nshepherd mid the sheep of his flock. So soon as ever ye\\nshall see him couched, even then mind you of your might and\\nstrength, and hold him there, despite his eagerness and\\nstriving to be free. And he will make assay, and take all\\nmanner of shapes of things that creep upon the earth, of\\nwater likewise, and of fierce fire burning. But do ye grasp\\nhim steadfastly and press him yet the more, and at length\\nwhen he questions thee in his proper shape, as he was when\\nfirst ye saw him laid to rest, then, hero, hold thy strong\\nhands, and let the ancient one go free, and ask him which\\nof the gods is hard upon thee, and as touching thy\\nreturning, how thou mayest go over the teeming deep.\"\\n\\n\\'Therewith she dived beneath the heaving sea, but I betook\\nme to the ships where they stood in the sand, and my heart\\nwas darkly troubled as I went. But after I had come down to\\nthe ship and to the sea, and we had made ready our supper\\nand immortal night had come on, then did we lay us to rest\\nupon the sea-beach. So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the\\nrosy fingered, in that hour I walked by the shore of the\\nwide-wayed sea, praying instantly to the gods; and I took\\nwith me three of my company, in whom I trusted most for\\nevery enterprise.\\n\\n\\'Meanwhile, so it was that she had plunged into the broad\\nbosom of the sea, and had brought from the deep the skins\\nof four sea-calves, and all were newly flayed, for she was\\nminded to lay a snare for her father. She scooped lairs on\\nthe sea-sand, and sat awaiting us, and we drew very nigh\\nher, and she made us all lie down in order, and cast a skin\\nover each. There would our ambush have been most terrible,\\nfor the deadly stench of the sea bred seals distressed us\\nsore: nay, who would lay him down by a beast of the sea?\\nBut herself she wrought deliverance, and devised a great\\ncomfort. She took ambrosia of a very sweet savour, and set\\nit beneath each man\\'s nostril, and did away with the stench\\nof the beast. So all the morning we waited with steadfast\\nheart, and the seals came forth in troops from the brine,\\nand then they couched them all orderly by the sea-beach.\\nAnd at high day the ancient one came forth from out of the\\nbrine, and found his fatted seals, yea and he went along\\ntheir line and told their tale; and first among the\\nsea-beasts he reckoned us, and guessed not that there was\\nguile, and afterward he too laid him down. Then we rushed\\nupon him with a cry, and cast our hands about him, nor did\\nthat ancient one forget his cunning. Now behold, at the\\nfirst he turned into a bearded lion, and thereafter into a\\nsnake, and a pard, and a huge boar; then he took the shape\\nof running water, and of a tall and flowering tree. We the\\nwhile held him close with steadfast heart. But when now\\nthat ancient one of the magic arts was aweary, then at last\\nhe questioned me and spake unto me, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Which of the gods was it, son of Atreus, that aided thee\\nwith his counsel, that thou mightest waylay and take me\\nperforce? What wouldest thou thereby?\"\\n\\n\\'Even so he spake, but I answered him saying; \"Old man,\\nthou knowest all, wherefore dost thou question me thereof\\nwith crooked words? For lo, I am holden long time in this\\nisle, neither can I find any issue therefrom, and my heart\\nfaileth within me. Howbeit do thou tell me--for the gods\\nknow all things--which of the immortals it is that bindeth\\nme here, and hath hindered me from my way; and declare as\\ntouching my returning, how I may go over the teeming deep.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so I spake, and he straightway answered me, saying:\\n\"Nay, surely thou shouldest have done goodly sacrifice to\\nZeus and the other gods ere thine embarking, that with most\\nspeed thou mightst reach thy country, sailing over the\\nwine-dark deep. For it is not thy fate to see thy friends,\\nand come to thy stablished house and thine own country,\\ntill thou hast passed yet again within the waters of\\nAegyptus, the heaven-fed stream, and offered holy hecatombs\\nto the deathless gods who keep the wide heaven. So shall\\nthe gods grant thee the path which thou desirest.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake he, but my spirit within me was broken, for that\\nhe bade me again to go to Aegyptus over the misty deep, a\\nlong and grievous way.\\n\\n\\'Yet even so I answered him saying: \"Old man, all this will\\nI do, according to thy word. But come, declare me this, and\\ntell it all plainly. Did all those Achaeans return safe\\nwith their ships, all whom Nestor and I left as we went\\nfrom Troy, or perished any by a shameful death aboard his\\nown ship, or in the arms of his friends, after he had wound\\nup the clew of war?\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and anon he answered me, saying: \"Son of\\nAtreus, why dost thou straitly question me hereof? Nay, it\\nis not for thy good to know or learn my thought; for I tell\\nthee thou shalt not long be tearless, when thou hast heard\\nit all aright. For many of these were taken, and many were\\nleft; but two only of the leaders of the mail-coated\\nAchaeans perished in returning; as for the battle, thou\\nthyself wast there. And one methinks is yet alive, and is\\nholden on the wide deep. Aias in truth was smitten in the\\nmidst of his ships of the long oars. Poseidon at first\\nbrought him nigh to Gyrae, to the mighty rocks, and\\ndelivered him from the sea. And so he would have fled his\\ndoom, albeit hated by Athene, had he not let a proud word\\nfall in the fatal darkening of his heart. He said that in\\nthe gods\\' despite he had escaped the great gulf of the sea;\\nand Poseidon heard his loud boasting, and presently caught\\nup his trident into his strong hands, and smote the rock\\nGyraean and cleft it in twain. And the one part abode in\\nhis place, but the other fell into the sea, the broken\\npiece whereon Aias sat at the first, when his heart was\\ndarkened. And the rock bore him down into the vast and\\nheaving deep; so there he perished when he had drunk of the\\nsalt sea water. But thy brother verily escaped the fates\\nand avoided them in his hollow ships, for queen Hera saved\\nhim. But now when he was like soon to reach the steep mount\\nof Malea, lo, the storm wind snatched him away and bore him\\nover the teeming deep, making great moan, to the border of\\nthe country whereof old Thyestes dwelt, but now Aegisthus\\nabode there, the son of Thyestes. But when thence too there\\nshowed a good prospect of safe returning, and the gods\\nchanged the wind to a fair gale, and they had reached home,\\nthen verily did Agamemnon set foot with joy upon his\\ncountry\\'s soil, and as he touched his own land he kissed\\nit, and many were the hot tears he let fall, for he saw his\\nland and was glad. And it was so that the watchman spied\\nhim from his tower, the watchman whom crafty Aegisthus had\\nled and posted there, promising him for a reward two\\ntalents of gold. Now he kept watch for the space of a year,\\nlest Agamemnon should pass by him when he looked not, and\\nmind him of his wild prowess. So he went to the house to\\nbear the tidings to the shepherd of the people. And\\nstraightway Aegisthus contrived a cunning treason. He chose\\nout twenty of the best men in the township, and set an\\nambush, and on the further side of the hall he commanded to\\nprepare a feast. Then with chariot and horses he went to\\nbid to the feast Agamemnon, shepherd of the people; but\\ncaitiff thoughts were in his heart. He brought him up to\\nhis house, all unwitting of his doom, and when he had\\nfeasted him slew him, as one slayeth an ox at the stall.\\nAnd none of the company of Atreides that were of his\\nfollowing were left, nor any of the men of Aegisthus, but\\nthey were all killed in the halls.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake he, and my spirit within me was broken, and I\\nwept as I sat upon the sand, nor was I minded any more to\\nlive and see the light of the sun. But when I had taken my\\nfill of weeping and grovelling on the ground, then spake\\nthe ancient one of the sea, whose speech is sooth:\\n\\n\\'\"No more, son of Atreus, hold this long weeping without\\ncease, for we shall find no help therein. Rather with all\\nhaste make essay that so thou mayest come to thine own\\ncountry. For either thou shalt find Aegisthus yet alive, or\\nit may be Orestes was beforehand with thee and slew him; so\\nmayest thou chance upon his funeral feast.\"\\n\\n\\'So he spake, and my heart and lordly soul again were\\ncomforted for all my sorrow, and I uttered my voice and I\\nspake to him winged words:\\n\\n\\'\"Their fate I now know; but tell me of the third; who is\\nit that is yet living and holden on the wide deep, or\\nperchance is dead? and fain would I hear despite my\\nsorrow.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and straightway he answered, and said: \"It is\\nthe son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca; and I saw\\nhim in an island shedding big tears in the halls of the\\nnymph Calypso, who holds him there perforce; so he may not\\ncome to his own country, for he has by him no ships with\\noars, and no companions to send him on his way over the\\nbroad back of the sea. But thou, Menelaus, son of Zeus, art\\nnot ordained to die and meet thy fate in Argos, the\\npasture-land of horses, but the deathless gods will convey\\nthee to the Elysian plain and the world\\'s end, where is\\nRhadamanthus of the fair hair, where life is easiest for\\nmen. No snow is there, nor yet great storm, nor any rain;\\nbut always ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill\\nWest to blow cool on men; yea, for thou hast Helen to wife,\\nand thereby they deem thee to be son of Zeus.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake he, and plunged into the heaving sea; but I\\nbetook me to the ships with my godlike company, and my\\nheart was darkly troubled as I went. Now after I had come\\ndown to the ship and to the sea, and had made ready our\\nsupper, and immortal night had come on, then did we lay us\\nto rest upon the sea-beach. So soon as early Dawn shone\\nforth, the rosy-fingered, first of all we drew down our\\nships to the fair salt sea and placed the masts and the\\nsails in the gallant ships, and the crew too climbed on\\nboard, and sat upon the benches and smote the grey sea\\nwater with their oars. Then back I went to the waters of\\nAegyptus, the heaven-fed stream, and there I moored the\\nships and offered the acceptable sacrifice of hecatombs. So\\nwhen I had appeased the anger of the everlasting gods, I\\npiled a barrow to Agamemnon, that his fame might never be\\nquenched. So having fulfilled all, I set out for home, and\\nthe deathless gods gave me a fair wind, and brought me\\nswiftly to mine own dear country. But lo, now tarry in my\\nhalls till it shall be the eleventh day hence or the\\ntwelfth. Then will I send thee with all honour on thy way,\\nand give thee splendid gifts, three horses and a polished\\ncar; and moreover I will give thee a goodly chalice, that\\nthou mayest pour forth before the deathless gods, and be\\nmindful of me all the days of thy life.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Son of Atreus,\\nnay, hold me not long time here. Yea even for a year would\\nI be content to sit by thee, and no desire for home or\\nparents would come upon me; for I take wondrous pleasure in\\nthy tales and talk. But already my company wearieth in fair\\nPylos, and yet thou art keeping me long time here. And\\nwhatsoever gift thou wouldest give me, let it be a thing to\\ntreasure; but horses I will take none to Ithaca, but leave\\nthem here to grace thine own house, for thou art lord of a\\nwide plain wherein is lotus great plenty, and therein is\\nspear-reed and wheat and rye, and white and spreading\\nbarley. In Ithaca there are no wide courses, nor meadow\\nland at all. It is a pasture-land of goats, and more\\npleasant in my sight than one that pastureth horses; for of\\nthe isles that lie and lean upon the sea, none are fit for\\nthe driving of horses, or rich in meadow land, and least of\\nall is Ithaca.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and Menelaus, of the loud war cry, smiled, and\\ncaressed him with his hand, and spake and hailed him:\\n\\n\\'Thou art of gentle blood, dear child, so gentle the words\\nthou speakest. Therefore I will make exchange of the\\npresents, as I may. Of the gifts, such as are treasures\\nstored in my house, I will give thee the goodliest and\\ngreatest of price. I will give thee a mixing bowl\\nbeautifully wrought; it is all of silver, and the lips\\nthereof are finished with gold, the work of Hephaestus; and\\nthe hero Phaedimus, the king of the Sidonians, gave it me,\\nwhen his house sheltered me on my coming thither, and to\\nthee now would I give it.\\'\\n\\nEven so they spake one to another, while the guests came to\\nthe palace of the divine king. They drave their sheep, and\\nbrought wine that maketh glad the heart of man: and their\\nwives with fair tire sent them wheaten bread. Thus were\\nthese men preparing the feast in the halls.\\n\\nBut the wooers meantime were before the palace of Odysseus,\\ntaking their pleasure in casting of weights and spears, on\\na levelled place, as heretofore, in their insolence. And\\nAntinous and god-like Eurymachus were seated there, the\\nchief men of the wooers, who were far the most excellent of\\nall. And Noemon, son of Phromius, drew nigh to them and\\nspake unto Antinous and questioned him, saying:\\n\\n\\'Antinous, know we at all, or know we not, when Telemachus\\nwill return from sandy Pylos? He hath departed with a ship\\nof mine, and I have need thereof, to cross over into\\nspacious Elis, where I have twelve brood mares with hardy\\nmules unbroken at the teat; I would drive off one of these\\nand break him in.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and they were amazed, for they deemed not that\\nTelemachus had gone to Neleian Pylos, but that he was at\\nhome somewhere in the fields, whether among the flocks, or\\nwith the swineherd.\\n\\nThen Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spake to him in turn:\\n\\'Tell me the plain truth; when did he go, and what noble\\nyouths went with him? Were they chosen men of Ithaca or\\nhirelings and thralls of his own? He was in case to bring\\neven that about. And tell me this in good sooth, that I may\\nknow for a surety: did he take thy black ship from thee\\nperforce against thy will? or didst thou give it him of\\nfree will at his entreaty?\\n\\nThen Noemon, son of Phromius, answered him saying: \\'I gave\\nit him myself of free will. What can any man do, when such\\nan one, so bestead with care, begs a favour? it were hard\\nto deny the gift. The youths who next to us are noblest in\\nthe land, even these have gone with him; and I marked their\\nleader on board ship, Mentor, or a god who in all things\\nresembled Mentor. But one matter I marvel at: I saw the\\ngoodly Mentor here yesterday toward dawn, though already he\\nhad embarked for Pylos.\\'\\n\\nHe spake and withal departed to his father\\'s house. And the\\nproud spirits of these twain were angered, and they made\\nthe wooers sit down together and cease from their games.\\nAnd among them spake Antinous, son of Eupeithes, in\\ndispleasure; and his black heart was wholly filled with\\nrage, and his eyes were like flaming fire:\\n\\n\\'Out on him, a proud deed hath Telemachus accomplished with\\na high hand, even this journey, and we thought that he\\nwould never bring it to pass! This lad hath clean gone\\nwithout more ado, in spite of us all; his ship he hath let\\nhaul to the sea, and chosen the noblest in the township. He\\nwill begin to be our bane even more than heretofore; but\\nmay Zeus destroy his might, not ours, ere he reach the\\nmeasure of manhood! But come, give me a swift ship and\\ntwenty men, that I may lie in watch and wait even for him\\non his way home, in the strait between Ithaca and rugged\\nSamos, that so he may have a woeful end of his cruising in\\nquest of his father.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and they all assented thereto, and bade him to\\nthe work. And thereupon they arose and went to the house of\\nOdysseus.\\n\\nNow it was no long time before Penelope heard of the\\ncounsel that the wooers had devised in the deep of their\\nheart. For the henchman Medon told her thereof, who stood\\nwithout the court and heard their purposes, while they were\\nweaving their plot within. So he went on his way through\\nthe halls to bring the news to Penelope; and as he stept\\ndown over the threshold, Penelope spake unto him:\\n\\n\\'Henchman, wherefore have the noble wooers sent thee forth?\\nWas it to tell the handmaids of divine Odysseus to cease\\nfrom their work, and prepare a banquet for them? Nay, after\\nthus much wooing, never again may they come together, but\\nhere this day sup for their last and latest time; all ye\\nwho assemble so often, and waste much livelihood, the\\nwealth of wise Telemachus! Long ago when ye were children,\\nye marked not your fathers\\' telling, what manner of man was\\nOdysseus among them, one that wrought no iniquity toward\\nany man, nor spake aught unrighteous in the township, as is\\nthe wont of divine kings. One man a king is like to hate,\\nanother he might chance to love. But never did he do aught\\nat all presumptuously to any man. Nay, it is plain what\\nspirit ye are of, and your unseemly deeds are manifest to\\nall, nor is there any gratitude left for kindness done.\\'\\n\\nThen Medon, wise of heart, answered her: \\'Would, oh queen,\\nthat this were the crowning evil! But the wooers devise\\nanother far greater and more grievous, which I pray the son\\nof Cronos may never fulfil! They are set on slaying\\nTelemachus with the edge of the sword on his homeward way;\\nfor he is gone to fair Pylos and goodly Lacedaemon, to seek\\ntidings of his father.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, but her knees were loosened where she stood,\\nand her heart melted within her, and long time was she\\nspeechless, and lo, her eyes were filled with tears and the\\nvoice of her utterance was stayed. And at the last she\\nanswered him and said:\\n\\n\\'Henchman, wherefore I pray thee is my son departed? There\\nis no need that he should go abroad on swift ships, that\\nserve men for horses on the sea, and that cross the great\\nwet waste. Is it that even his own name may no more be left\\nupon earth?\\'\\n\\nThen Medon, wise of heart, answered her: \\'I know not\\nwhether some god set him on or whether his own spirit\\nstirred him to go to Pylos to seek tidings of his father\\'s\\nreturn, or to hear what end he met.\\'\\n\\nHe spake, and departed through the house of Odysseus, and\\non her fell a cloud of consuming grief; so that she might\\nno more endure to seat her on a chair, whereof there were\\nmany in the house, but there she crouched on the threshold\\nof her well-builded chamber, wailing piteously, and her\\nhandmaids round her made low moan, as many as were in the\\nhouse with her, young and old. And Penelope spake among\\nthem pouring forth her lamentation:\\n\\n\\'Hear me, my friends, for the Olympian sire hath given me\\npain exceedingly beyond all women who were born and bred in\\nmy day. For erewhile I lost my noble lord of the lion\\nheart, adorned with all perfection among the Danaans, my\\ngood lord, whose fame is noised abroad from Hellas to mid\\nArgos. And now again the storm-winds have snatched away my\\nwell-beloved son without tidings from our halls, nor heard\\nI of his departure. Oh, women, hard of heart, that even ye\\ndid not each one let the thought come into your minds, to\\nrouse me from my couch when he went to the black hollow\\nship, though ye knew full well thereof! For had I heard\\nthat he was purposing this journey, verily he should have\\nstayed here still, though eager to be gone, or have left me\\ndead in the halls. Howbeit let some one make haste to call\\nthe ancient Dolius, my thrall, whom my father gave me ere\\nyet I had come hither, who keepeth my garden of trees. So\\nshall he go straightway and sit by Laertes, and tell him\\nall, if perchance Laertes may weave some counsel in his\\nheart, and go forth and make his plaint to the people, who\\nare purposed to destroy his seed, and the seed of god-like\\nOdysseus.\\'\\n\\nThen the good nurse Eurycleia answered her: \\'Dear lady,\\naye, slay me if thou wilt with the pitiless sword or let me\\nyet live on in the house,--yet will I not hide my saying\\nfrom thee. I knew all this, and gave him whatsoever he\\ncommanded, bread and sweet wine. And he took a great oath\\nof me not to tell thee till at least the twelfth day should\\ncome, or thou thyself shouldst miss him and hear of his\\ndeparture, that thou mightest not mar thy fair flesh with\\nthy tears. But now, wash thee in water, and take to thee\\nclean raiment and ascend to thy upper chamber with the\\nwomen thy handmaids, and pray to Athene, daughter of Zeus,\\nlord of the aegis. For so may she save him even from death.\\nAnd heap not troubles on an old man\\'s trouble; for the seed\\nof the son of Arceisius, is not, methinks, utterly hated by\\nthe blessed gods, but someone will haply yet remain to\\npossess these lofty halls, and the fat fields far away.\\'\\n\\nSo spake she, and lulled her queen\\'s lamentation, and made\\nher eyes to cease from weeping. So she washed her in water,\\nand took to her clean raiment, and ascended to the upper\\nchamber with the women her handmaids, and placed the meal\\nfor sprinkling in a basket, and prayed unto Athene:\\n\\n\\'Hear me, child of Zeus, lord of the aegis, unwearied\\nmaiden! If ever wise Odysseus in his halls burnt for thee\\nfat slices of the thighs of heifer or of sheep, these\\nthings, I pray thee, now remember, and save my dear son,\\nand ward from him the wooers in the naughtiness of their\\npride.\\'\\n\\nTherewith she raised a cry, and the goddess heard her\\nprayer. But the wooers clamoured through the shadowy halls,\\nand thus would some proud youth say:\\n\\n\\'Verily this queen of many wooers prepareth our marriage,\\nnor knoweth at all how that for her son death hath been\\nordained.\\'\\n\\nThus would certain of them speak, but they knew not how\\nthese things were ordained. And Antinous made harangue and\\nspake among them:\\n\\n\\'Good sirs, my friends, shun all disdainful words alike,\\nlest someone hear and tell it even in the house. But come\\nlet us arise, and in silence accomplish that whereof we\\nspake, for the counsel pleased us every one.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he chose twenty men that were the best, and they\\ndeparted to the swift ship and the sea-banks. So first of\\nall they drew the ship down to the deep water, and placed\\nthe mast and sails in the black ship, and fixed the oars in\\nleathern loops all orderly, and spread forth the white\\nsails. And squires, haughty of heart, bare for them their\\narms. And they moored her high out in the shore water, and\\nthemselves disembarked. There they supped and waited for\\nevening to come on.\\n\\nBut the wise Penelope lay there in her upper chamber,\\nfasting and tasting neither meat nor drink, musing whether\\nher noble son should escape death, or even fall before the\\nproud wooers. And as a lion broods all in fear among the\\npress of men, when they draw the crafty ring around him, so\\ndeeply was she musing when deep sleep came over her. And\\nshe sank back in sleep and all her joints were loosened.\\n\\nNow the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to other\\nthoughts. She made a phantom, and fashioned it after the\\nlikeness of a woman, Iphthime, daughter of great-hearted\\nIcarius, whom Eumelus wedded, whose dwelling was in Pherae.\\nAnd she sent it to the house of divine Odysseus to bid\\nPenelope, amid her sorrow and lamenting, to cease from her\\nweeping and tearful lamentation. So the phantom passed into\\nthe chamber by the thong of the bolt, and stood above her\\nhead and spake unto her, saying:\\n\\n\\'Sleepest thou, Penelope, stricken at heart? Nay, even the\\ngods who live at ease suffer thee not to wail or be\\nafflicted, seeing that thy son is yet to return; for no\\nsinner is he in the eyes of the gods.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope made her answer as she slumbered very\\nsoftly at the gates of dreams:\\n\\n\\'Wherefore, sister, hast thou come hither, that before wert\\nnot wont to come, for thou hast thine habitation very far\\naway? Biddest thou me indeed to cease from the sorrows and\\npains, so many that disquiet my heart and soul? Erewhile I\\nlost my noble lord of the lion heart, adorned with all\\nperfection among the Danaans, my true lord, whose fame is\\nnoised abroad from Hellas to mid Argos. And now, again, my\\nwell-beloved son is departed on his hollow ship, poor\\nchild, not skilled in toils or in the gatherings of men.\\nFor him I sorrow yet more than for my lord, and I tremble\\nand fear for him lest aught befal him, whether, it may be,\\namid that folk where he is gone, or in the deep. For many\\nfoemen devise evil against him, and go about to kill him,\\nor ever he come to his own country.\\'\\n\\nAnd the dim phantom answered her, and said: \\'Take courage,\\nand be not so sorely afraid. For lo, such a friend goes to\\nguide him, as all men pray to stand by them, for that she\\nhath the power, even Pallas Athene. And she pitieth thee in\\nthy sorrow, and now hath sent me forth to speak these words\\nto thee.\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Penelope answered her, saying: \\'If thou art indeed\\na god, and hast heard the word of a god, come, I pray thee,\\nand tell me tidings concerning that ill-fated man, whether\\nperchance he is yet alive and sees the light of the sun, or\\nhath already died, and is a dweller in the house of Hades.\\'\\n\\nAnd the dim phantom answered her and said: \\'Concerning him\\nI will not tell thee all the tale, whether he be alive or\\ndead; it is ill to speak words light as wind.\\'\\n\\nTherewith the phantom slipped away by the bolt of the door\\nand passed into the breath of the wind. And the daughter of\\nIcarius started up from sleep; and her heart was cheered,\\nso clear was the vision that sped toward her in the dead of\\nthe night.\\n\\nMeanwhile the wooers had taken ship and were sailing over\\nthe wet ways, pondering in their hearts sheer death for\\nTelemachus. Now there is a rocky isle in the mid sea,\\nmidway between Ithaca and rugged Samos, Asteris, a little\\nisle; and there is a harbour therein with a double\\nentrance, where ships may ride. There the Achaeans abode\\nlying in wait for Telemachus.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook V\\n\\n  The Gods in council command Calypso by Hermes to send away\\n  Odysseus on a raft of trees; and Poseidon, returning from\\n  Ethiopia and seeing him on the coast of Phaeacia, scattered\\n  his raft; and how by the help of Ino he was thrown ashore,\\n  and slept on a heap of dry leaves till the next day.\\n\\nNow the Dawn arose from her couch, from the side of the\\nlordly Tithonus, to bear light to the immortals and to\\nmortal men. And lo, the gods were gathering to session, and\\namong them Zeus, that thunders on high, whose might is\\nabove all. And Athene told them the tale of the many woes\\nof Odysseus, recalling them to mind; for near her heart was\\nhe that then abode in the dwelling of the nymph:\\n\\n\\'Father Zeus, and all ye other blessed gods that live for\\never, henceforth let not any sceptred king be kind and\\ngentle with all his heart, nor minded to do righteously,\\nbut let him alway be a hard man and work unrighteousness,\\nfor behold, there is none that remembereth divine Odysseus\\nof the people whose lord he was, and was gentle as a\\nfather. Howbeit, as for him he lieth in an island suffering\\nstrong pains, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who\\nholdeth him perforce; so he may not reach his own country,\\nfor he hath no ships by him with oars, and no companions to\\nsend him on his way over the broad back of the sea. And\\nnow, again, they are set on slaying his beloved son on his\\nhomeward way, for he is gone to fair Pylos and to goodly\\nLacedaemon, to seek tidings of his father.\\'\\n\\nAnd Zeus, gatherer of the clouds, answered and spake unto\\nher: \\'My child, what word hath escaped the door of thy\\nlips? Nay, didst thou not thyself plan this device, that\\nOdysseus may assuredly take vengeance on those men at his\\ncoming? As for Telemachus, do thou guide him by thine art,\\nas well as thou mayest, that so he may come to his own\\ncountry all unharmed, and the wooers may return in their\\nship with their labour all in vain.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he spake to Hermes, his dear son: \\'Hermes,\\nforasmuch as even in all else thou art our herald, tell\\nunto the nymph of the braided tresses my unerring counsel,\\neven the return of the patient Odysseus, how he is to come\\nto his home, with no furtherance of gods or of mortal men.\\nNay, he shall sail on a well-bound raft, in sore distress,\\nand on the twentieth day arrive at fertile Scheria, even at\\nthe land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the\\ngods. And they shall give him all worship heartily as to a\\ngod, and send him on his way in a ship to his own dear\\ncountry, with gifts of bronze and gold, and raiment in\\nplenty, much store, such as never would Odysseus have won\\nfor himself out of Troy, yea, though he had returned unhurt\\nwith the share of the spoil that fell to him. On such wise\\nis he fated to see his friends, and come to his high-roofed\\nhome and his own country.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, nor heedless was the messenger, the slayer of\\nArgos. Straightway he bound beneath his feet his lovely\\ngolden sandals, that wax not old, that bare him alike over\\nthe wet sea and over the limitless land, swift as the\\nbreath of the wind. And he took the wand wherewith he lulls\\nthe eyes of whomso he will, while others again he even\\nwakes from out of sleep. With this rod in his hand flew the\\nstrong slayer of Argos. Above Pieria he passed and leapt\\nfrom the upper air into the deep. Then he sped along the\\nwave like the cormorant, that chaseth the fishes through\\nthe perilous gulfs of the unharvested sea, and wetteth his\\nthick plumage in the brine. Such like did Hermes ride upon\\nthe press of the waves. But when he had now reached that\\nfar-off isle, he went forth from the sea of violet blue to\\nget him up into the land, till he came to a great cave,\\nwherein dwelt the nymph of the braided tresses: and he\\nfound her within. And on the hearth there was a great fire\\nburning, and from afar through the isle was smelt the\\nfragrance of cleft cedar blazing, and of sandal wood. And\\nthe nymph within was singing with a sweet voice as she\\nfared to and fro before the loom, and wove with a shuttle\\nof gold. And round about the cave there was a wood\\nblossoming, alder and poplar and sweet-smelling cypress.\\nAnd therein roosted birds long of wing, owls and falcons\\nand chattering sea-crows, which have their business in the\\nwaters. And lo, there about the hollow cave trailed a\\ngadding garden vine, all rich with clusters. And fountains\\nfour set orderly were running with clear water, hard by one\\nanother, turned each to his own course. And all around soft\\nmeadows bloomed of violets and parsley, yea, even a\\ndeathless god who came thither might wonder at the sight\\nand be glad at heart. There the messenger, the slayer of\\nArgos, stood and wondered. Now when he had gazed at all\\nwith wonder, anon he went into the wide cave; nor did\\nCalypso, that fair goddess, fail to know him, when she saw\\nhim face to face; for the gods use not to be strange one to\\nanother, the immortals, not though one have his habitation\\nfar away. But he found not Odysseus, the greathearted,\\nwithin the cave, who sat weeping on the shore even as\\naforetime, straining his soul with tears and groans and\\ngriefs, and as he wept he looked wistfully over the\\nunharvested deep. And Calypso, that fair goddess,\\nquestioned Hermes, when she had made him sit on a bright\\nshining seat:\\n\\n\\'Wherefore, I pray thee, Hermes, of the golden wand, hast\\nthou come hither, worshipful and welcome, whereas as of old\\nthou wert not wont to visit me? Tell me all thy thought; my\\nheart is set on fulfilling it, if fulfil it I may, and if\\nit hath been fulfilled in the counsel of fate. But now\\nfollow me further, that I may set before thee the\\nentertainment of strangers.\\'\\n\\nTherewith the goddess spread a table with ambrosia and set\\nit by him, and mixed the ruddy nectar. So the messenger,\\nthe slayer of Argos, did eat and drink. Now after he had\\nsupped and comforted his soul with food, at the last he\\nanswered, and spake to her on this wise:\\n\\n\\'Thou makest question of me on my coming, a goddess of a\\ngod, and I will tell thee this my saying truly, at thy\\ncommand. \\'Twas Zeus that bade me come hither, by no will of\\nmine; nay, who of his free will would speed over such a\\nwondrous space of brine, whereby is no city of mortals that\\ndo sacrifice to the gods, and offer choice hecatombs? But\\nsurely it is in no wise possible for another god to go\\nbeyond or to make void the purpose of Zeus, lord of the\\naegis. He saith that thou hast with thee a man most\\nwretched beyond his fellows, beyond those men that round\\nthe burg of Priam for nine years fought, and in the tenth\\nyear sacked the city and departed homeward. Yet on the way\\nthey sinned against Athene, and she raised upon them an\\nevil blast and long waves of the sea. Then all the rest of\\nhis good company was lost, but it came to pass that the\\nwind bare and the wave brought him hither. And now Zeus\\nbiddeth thee send him hence with what speed thou mayest,\\nfor it is not ordained that he die away from his friends,\\nbut rather it is his fate to look on them even yet, and to\\ncome to his high-roofed home and his own country.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and Calypso, that fair goddess, shuddered and\\nuttered her voice, and spake unto him winged words: \\'Hard\\nare ye gods and jealous exceeding, who ever grudge\\ngoddesses openly to mate with men, if any make a mortal her\\ndear bed-fellow. Even so when rosy-fingered Dawn took Orion\\nfor her lover, ye gods that live at ease were jealous\\nthereof, till chaste Artemis, of the golden throne, slew\\nhim in Ortygia with the visitation of her gentle shafts. So\\ntoo when fair-tressed Demeter yielded to her love, and lay\\nwith Iasion in the thrice-ploughed fallow-field, Zeus was\\nnot long without tidings thereof, and cast at him with his\\nwhite bolt and slew him. So again ye gods now grudge that a\\nmortal man should dwell with me. Him I saved as he went all\\nalone bestriding the keel of a bark, for that Zeus had\\ncrushed {*} and cleft his swift ship with a white bolt in\\nthe midst of the wine-dark deep. There all the rest of his\\ngood company was lost, but it came to pass that the wind\\nbare and the wave brought him hither. And him have I loved\\nand cherished, and I said that I would make him to know not\\ndeath and age for ever. Yet forasmuch as it is no wise\\npossible for another god to go beyond, or make void the\\npurpose of Zeus, lord of the aegis, let him away over the\\nunharvested seas, if the summons and the bidding be of\\nZeus. But I will give him no despatch, not I, for I have no\\nships by me with oars, nor company to bear him on his way\\nover the broad back of the sea. Yet will I be forward to\\nput this in his mind, and will hide nought, that all\\nunharmed he may come to his own country.\\'\\n\\n{* It seems very doubtful whether [Greek] can bear this\\nmeaning. The reading [Greek], \\'smote,\\' preserved by the\\nSchol. is highly probable.}\\n\\nThen the messenger, the slayer of Argos, answered her:\\n\\'Yea, speed him now upon his path and have regard unto the\\nwrath of Zeus, lest haply he be angered and bear hard on\\nthee hereafter.\\'\\n\\nTherewith the great slayer of Argos departed, but the lady\\nnymph went on her way to the great-hearted Odysseus, when\\nshe had heard the message of Zeus. And there she found him\\nsitting on the shore, and his eyes were never dry of tears,\\nand his sweet life was ebbing away as he mourned for his\\nreturn; for the nymph no more found favour in his sight.\\nHowsoever by night he would sleep by her, as needs he must,\\nin the hollow caves, unwilling lover by a willing lady. And\\nin the day-time he would sit on the rocks and on the beach,\\nstraining his soul with tears, and groans, and griefs, and\\nthrough his tears he would look wistfully over the\\nunharvested deep. So standing near him that fair goddess\\nspake to him:\\n\\n\\'Hapless man, sorrow no more I pray thee in this isle, nor\\nlet thy good life waste away, for even now will I send thee\\nhence with all my heart. Nay, arise and cut long beams, and\\nfashion a wide raft with the axe, and lay deckings high\\nthereupon, that it may bear thee over the misty deep. And I\\nwill place therein bread and water, and red wine to thy\\nheart\\'s desire, to keep hunger far away. And I will put\\nraiment upon thee, and send a fair gale in thy wake, that\\nso thou mayest come all unharmed to thine own country, if\\nindeed it be the good pleasure of the gods who hold wide\\nheaven, who are stronger than I am both to will and to do.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus shuddered,\\nand uttering his voice spake to her winged words: \\'Herein,\\ngoddess, thou hast plainly some other thought, and in no\\nwise my furtherance, for that thou biddest me to cross in a\\nraft the great gulf of the sea so dread and difficult,\\nwhich not even the swift gallant ships pass over rejoicing\\nin the breeze of Zeus. Nor would I go aboard a raft to\\ndispleasure thee, unless thou wilt deign, O goddess, to\\nswear a great oath not to plan any hidden guile to mine own\\nhurt.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and Calypso, the fair goddess, smiled and\\ncaressed him with her hand, and spake and hailed him:\\n\\n\\'Knavish thou art, and no weakling {*} in wit, thou that\\nhast conceived and spoken such a word. Let earth be now\\nwitness hereto, and the wide heaven above, and that falling\\nwater of the Styx, the greatest oath and the most terrible\\nto the blessed gods, that I will not plan any hidden guile\\nto thine own hurt. Nay, but my thoughts are such, and such\\nwill be my counsel, as I would devise for myself, if ever\\nso sore a need came over me. For I too have a righteous\\nmind, and my heart within me is not of iron, but pitiful\\neven as thine.\\'\\n\\n{* [Greek], from root [Greek], \\'ill-grown,\\' i. e. a\\nweakling, in the literal sense as B. xi.249, xiv.212, or\\nmetaphorical, as here and viii. 177.}\\n\\nTherewith the fair goddess led the way quickly, and he\\nfollowed hard in the steps of the goddess. And they reached\\nthe hollow cave, the goddess and the man; so he sat him\\ndown upon the chair whence Hermes had arisen, and the nymph\\nplaced by him all manner of food to eat and drink, such as\\nis meat for men. As for her she sat over against divine\\nOdysseus, and the handmaids placed by her ambrosia and\\nnectar. So they put forth their hands upon the good cheer\\nset before them. But after they had taken their fill of\\nmeat and drink, Calypso, the fair goddess, spake first and\\nsaid:\\n\\n\\'Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many\\ndevices, so it is indeed thy wish to get thee home to thine\\nown dear country even in this hour? Good fortune go with\\nthee even so! Yet didst thou know in thine heart what a\\nmeasure of suffering thou art ordained to fulfil, or ever\\nthou reach thine own country, here, even here, thou wouldst\\nabide with me and keep this house, and wouldst never taste\\nof death, though thou longest to see thy wife, for whom\\nthou hast ever a desire day by day. Not in sooth that I\\navow me to be less noble than she in form or fashion, for\\nit is in no wise meet that mortal women should match them\\nwith immortals, in shape and comeliness.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered, and spake unto her:\\n\\'Be not wroth with me hereat, goddess and queen. Myself I\\nknow it well, how wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than\\nthou, in comeliness and stature. But she is mortal and thou\\nknowest not age nor death. Yet even so, I wish and long day\\nby day to fare homeward and see the day of my returning.\\nYea, and if some god shall wreck me in the wine-dark deep,\\neven so I will endure, with a heart within me patient of\\naffliction. For already have I suffered full much, and much\\nhave I toiled in perils of waves and war; let this be added\\nto the tale of those.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and the sun sank and darkness came on. Then\\nthey twain went into the chamber of the hollow rock, and\\nhad their delight of love, abiding each by other.\\n\\nSo soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, anon\\nOdysseus put on him a mantle and doublet, and the nymph\\nclad her in a great shining robe, light of woof and\\ngracious, and about her waist she cast a fair golden\\ngirdle, and a veil withal upon her head. Then she\\nconsidered of the sending of Odysseus, the great-hearted.\\nShe gave him a great axe, fitted to his grasp, an axe of\\nbronze double-edged, and with a goodly handle of olive wood\\nfastened well. Next she gave him a polished adze, and she\\nled the way to the border of the isle where tall trees\\ngrew, alder and poplar, and pine that reacheth unto heaven,\\nseasoned long since and sere, that might lightly float for\\nhim. Now after she had shown him where the tall trees grew,\\nCalypso, the fair goddess, departed homeward. And he set to\\ncutting timber, and his work went busily. Twenty trees in\\nall he felled, and then trimmed them with the axe of\\nbronze, and deftly smoothed them, and over them made\\nstraight the line. Meanwhile Calypso, the fair goddess,\\nbrought him augers, so he bored each piece and jointed them\\ntogether, and then made all fast with trenails and dowels.\\nWide as is the floor of a broad ship of burden, which some\\nman well skilled in carpentry may trace him out, of such\\nbeam did Odysseus fashion his broad raft. And thereat he\\nwrought, and set up the deckings, fitting them to the\\nclose-set uprights, and finished them off with long\\ngunwales, and there he set a mast, and a yard-arm fitted\\nthereto, and moreover he made him a rudder to guide the\\ncraft. And he fenced it with wattled osier withies from\\nstem to stern, to be a bulwark against the wave, and piled\\nup wood to back them. Meanwhile Calypso, the fair goddess,\\nbrought him web of cloth to make him sails; and these too\\nhe fashioned very skilfully. And he made fast therein\\nbraces and halyards and sheets, and at last he pushed the\\nraft with levers down to the fair salt sea.\\n\\nIt was the fourth day when he had accomplished all. And,\\nlo, on the fifth, the fair Calypso sent him on his way from\\nthe island, when she had bathed him and clad him in\\nfragrant attire. Moreover, the goddess placed on board the\\nship two skins, one of dark wine, and another, a great one,\\nof water, and corn too in a wallet, and she set therein a\\nstore of dainties to his heart\\'s desire, and sent forth a\\nwarm and gentle wind to blow. And goodly Odysseus rejoiced\\nas he set his sails to the breeze. So he sate and cunningly\\nguided the craft with the helm, nor did sleep fall upon his\\neyelids, as he viewed the Pleiads and Bootes, that setteth\\nlate, and the Bear, which they likewise call the Wain,\\nwhich turneth ever in one place, and keepeth watch upon\\nOrion, and alone hath no part in the baths of Ocean. This\\nstar, Calypso, the fair goddess, bade him to keep ever on\\nthe left as he traversed the deep. Ten days and seven he\\nsailed traversing the deep, and on the eighteenth day\\nappeared the shadowy hills of the land of the Phaeacians,\\nat the point where it lay nearest to him; and it showed\\nlike a shield in the misty deep.\\n\\nNow the lord, the shaker of the earth, on his way from the\\nEthiopians espied him afar off from the mountains of the\\nSolymi: even thence he saw Odysseus as he sailed over the\\ndeep; and he was mightily angered in spirit, and shaking\\nhis head he communed with his own heart. \\'Lo now, it must\\nbe that the gods at the last have changed their purpose\\nconcerning Odysseus, while I was away among the Ethiopians.\\nAnd now he is nigh to the Phaeacian land, where it is\\nordained that he escape the great issues of the woe which\\nhath come upon him. But, methinks, that even yet I will\\ndrive him far enough in the path of suffering.\\'\\n\\nWith that he gathered the clouds and troubled the waters of\\nthe deep, grasping his trident in his hands; and he roused\\nall storms of all manner of winds, and shrouded in clouds\\nthe land and sea: and down sped night from heaven. The East\\nWind and the South Wind clashed, and the stormy West, and\\nthe North, that is born in the bright air, rolling onward a\\ngreat wave. Then were the knees of Odysseus loosened and\\nhis heart melted, and heavily he spake to his own great\\nspirit:\\n\\n\\'Oh, wretched man that I am! what is to befal me at the\\nlast? I fear that indeed the goddess spake all things\\ntruly, who said that I should fill up the measure of sorrow\\non the deep, or ever I came to mine own country; and lo,\\nall these things have an end. In such wise doth Zeus crown\\nthe wide heaven with clouds, and hath troubled the deep,\\nand the blasts rush on of all the winds; yea, now is utter\\ndoom assured me. Thrice blessed those Danaans, yea, four\\ntimes blessed, who perished on a time in wide Troy-land,\\ndoing a pleasure to the sons of Atreus! Would to God that I\\ntoo had died, and met my fate on that day when the press of\\nTrojans cast their bronze-shod spears upon me, fighting for\\nthe body of the son of Peleus! So should I have gotten my\\ndues of burial, and the Achaeans would have spread my fame;\\nbut now it is my fate to be overtaken by a pitiful death.\\'\\n\\nEven as he spake, the great wave smote down upon him,\\ndriving on in terrible wise, that the raft reeled again.\\nAnd far therefrom he fell, and lost the helm from his hand;\\nand the fierce blast of the jostling winds came and brake\\nhis mast in the midst, and sail and yard-arm fell afar into\\nthe deep. Long time the water kept him under, nor could he\\nspeedily rise from beneath the rush of the mighty wave:\\nfor the garments hung heavy which fair Calypso gave him.\\nBut late and at length he came up, and spat forth from his\\nmouth the bitter salt water, which ran down in streams from\\nhis head. Yet even so forgat he not his raft, for all his\\nwretched plight, but made a spring after it in the waves,\\nand clutched it to him, and sat in the midst thereof,\\navoiding the issues of death; and the great wave swept it\\nhither and thither along the stream. And as the North Wind\\nin the harvest tide sweeps the thistle-down along the\\nplain, and close the tufts cling each to other, even so the\\nwinds bare the raft hither and thither along the main. Now\\nthe South would toss it to the North to carry, and now\\nagain the East would yield it to the West to chase.\\n\\nBut the daughter of Cadmus marked him, Ino of the fair\\nankles, Leucothea, who in time past was a maiden of mortal\\nspeech, but now in the depths of the salt sea she had\\ngotten her share of worship from the gods. She took pity on\\nOdysseus in his wandering and travail, and she rose, like a\\nsea-gull on the wing, from the depth of the mere, and sat\\nupon the well-bound raft and spake saying:\\n\\n\\'Hapless one, wherefore was Poseidon, shaker of the earth,\\nso wondrous wroth with thee, seeing that he soweth for thee\\nthe seeds of many evils? Yet shall he not make a full end\\nof thee, for all his desire. But do even as I tell thee,\\nand methinks thou art not witless. Cast off these garments,\\nand leave the raft to drift before the winds, but do thou\\nswim with thine hands and strive to win a footing on the\\ncoast {*} of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that thou\\nescape. Here, take this veil imperishable and wind it about\\nthy breast; so is there no fear that thou suffer aught or\\nperish. But when thou hast laid hold of the mainland with\\nthy hands, loose it from off thee and cast it into the\\nwine-dark deep far from the land, and thyself turn away.\\'\\n\\n{* Lit. Strive after an arrival on the land, etc. [Greek]\\noriginally meant going, journeying, and had no idea of\\nreturn. The earlier use survives here, and in Soph.\\nPhiloct. 43, Eur. Iph. Aul. 1261. Similarly, perhaps,\\n[Greek] in Odyssey iv.619, xv.119, and [Greek] frequently}\\n\\nWith that the goddess gave the veil, and for her part dived\\nback into the heaving deep, like a sea-gull: and the dark\\nwave closed over her. But the steadfast goodly Odysseus\\npondered, and heavily he spake to his own brave spirit:\\n\\n\\'Ah, woe is me! Can it be that some one of the immortals is\\nweaving a new snare for me, that she bids me quit my raft?\\nNay verily, I will not yet obey, for I had sight of the\\nshore yet a long way off, where she told me that I might\\nescape. I am resolved what I will do;--and methinks on this\\nwise it is best. So long as the timbers abide in the\\ndowels, so long will I endure steadfast in affliction, but\\nso soon as the wave hath shattered my raft asunder, I will\\nswim, for meanwhile no better counsel may be.\\'\\n\\nWhile yet he pondered these things in his heart and soul,\\nPoseidon, shaker of the earth, stirred against him a great\\nwave, terrible and grievous, and vaulted from the crest,\\nand therewith smote him. And as when a great tempestuous\\nwind tosseth a heap of parched husks, and scatters them\\nthis way and that, even so did the wave scatter the long\\nbeams of the raft. But Odysseus bestrode a single beam, as\\none rideth on a courser, and stript him of the garments\\nwhich fair Calypso gave him. And presently he wound the\\nveil beneath his breast, and fell prone into the sea,\\noutstretching his hands as one eager to swim. And the lord,\\nthe shaker of the earth, saw him and shook his head, and\\ncommuned with his own soul. \\'Even so, after all thy\\nsufferings, go wandering over the deep, till thou shalt\\ncome among a people, the fosterlings of Zeus. Yet for all\\nthat I deem not that thou shalt think thyself too lightly\\nafflicted.\\' Therewith he lashed his steeds of the flowing\\nmanes, and came to Aegae, where is his lordly home.\\n\\nBut Athene, daughter of Zeus, turned to new thoughts.\\nBehold, she bound up the courses of the other winds, and\\ncharged them all to cease and be still; but she roused the\\nswift North and brake the waves before him, that so\\nOdysseus, of the seed of Zeus, might mingle with the\\nPhaeacians, lovers of the oar, avoiding death and the\\nfates.\\n\\nSo for two nights and two days he was wandering in the\\nswell of the sea, and much his heart boded of death. But\\nwhen at last the fair-tressed Dawn brought the full light\\nof the third day, thereafter the breeze fell, and lo, there\\nwas a breathless calm, and with a quick glance ahead, (he\\nbeing upborne on a great wave,) he saw the land very near.\\nAnd even as when most welcome to his children is the sight\\nof a father\\'s life, who lies in sickness and strong pains\\nlong wasting away, some angry god assailing him; and to\\ntheir delight the gods have loosed him from his trouble; so\\nwelcome to Odysseus showed land and wood; and he swam\\nonward being eager to set foot on the strand. But when he\\nwas within earshot of the shore, and heard now the thunder\\nof the sea against the reefs--for the great wave crashed\\nagainst the dry land belching in terrible wise, and all was\\ncovered with foam of the sea,--for there were no harbours\\nfor ships nor shelters, but jutting headlands and reefs and\\ncliffs; then at last the knees of Odysseus were loosened\\nand his heart melted, and in heaviness he spake to his own\\nbrave spirit:\\n\\n\\'Ah me! now that beyond all hope Zeus hath given me sight\\nof land, and withal I have cloven my way through this gulf\\nof the sea, here there is no place to land on from out of\\nthe grey water. For without are sharp crags, and round them\\nthe wave roars surging, and sheer the smooth rock rises,\\nand the sea is deep thereby, so that in no wise may I find\\nfirm foothold and escape my bane, for as I fain would go\\nashore, the great wave may haply snatch and dash me on the\\njagged rock--and a wretched endeavour that would be. But if\\nI swim yet further along the coast to find, if I may, spits\\nthat take the waves aslant and havens of the sea, I fear\\nlest the storm-winds catch me again and bear me over the\\nteeming deep, making heavy moan; or else some god may even\\nsend forth against me a monster from out of the shore\\nwater; and many such pastureth the renowned Amphitrite. For\\nI know how wroth against me hath been the great Shaker of\\nthe Earth.\\'\\n\\nWhilst yet he pondered these things in his heart and mind,\\na great wave bore him to the rugged shore. There would he\\nhave been stript of his skin and all his bones been broken,\\nbut that the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put a thought into\\nhis heart. He rushed in, and with both his hands clutched\\nthe rock, whereto he clung till the great wave went by. So\\nhe escaped that peril, but again with backward wash it\\nleapt on him and smote him and cast him forth into the\\ndeep. And as when the cuttlefish is dragged forth from his\\nchamber, the many pebbles clinging to his suckers, even so\\nwas the skin stript from his strong hand against the rocks,\\nand the great wave closed over him. There of a truth would\\nluckless Odysseus have perished beyond that which was\\nordained, had not grey-eyed Athene given him sure counsel.\\nHe rose from the line of the breakers that belch upon the\\nshore, and swam outside, ever looking landwards, to find,\\nif he might, spits that take the waves aslant, and havens\\nof the sea. But when he came in his swimming over against\\nthe mouth of a fair-flowing river, whereby the place seemed\\nbest in his eyes, smooth of rocks, and withal there was a\\ncovert from the wind, Odysseus felt the river running, and\\nprayed to him in his heart:\\n\\n\\'Hear me, O king, whosoever thou art; unto thee am I come,\\nas to one to whom prayer is made, while I flee the rebukes\\nof Poseidon from the deep. Yea, reverend even to the\\ndeathless gods is that man who comes as a wanderer, even as\\nI now have come to thy stream and to thy knees after much\\ntravail. Nay pity me, O king; for I avow myself thy\\nsuppliant.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and the god straightway stayed his stream and\\nwithheld his waves, and made the water smooth before him,\\nand brought him safely to the mouths of the river. And his\\nknees bowed and his stout hands fell, for his heart was\\nbroken by the brine. And his flesh was all swollen and a\\ngreat stream of sea water gushed up through his mouth and\\nnostrils. So he lay without breath or speech, swooning,\\nsuch terrible weariness came upon him. But when now his\\nbreath returned and his spirit came to him again, he loosed\\nfrom off him the veil of the goddess, and let it fall into\\nthe salt flowing river. And the great wave bare it back\\ndown the stream, and lightly Ino caught it in her hands.\\nThen Odysseus turned from the river, and fell back in the\\nreeds, and kissed earth, the grain-giver, and heavily he\\nspake unto his own brave spirit:\\n\\n\\'Ah, woe is me! What is to betide me? What shall happen\\nunto me at the last? If I watch the river bed all through\\nthe careful night, I fear that the bitter frost and fresh\\ndew may overcome me, as I breathe forth my life for\\nfaintness, for the river breeze blows cold betimes in the\\nmorning. But if I climb the hill-side up to the shady wood,\\nand there take rest in the thickets, though perchance the\\ncold and weariness leave hold of me, and sweet sleep may\\ncome over me, I fear lest of wild beasts I become the spoil\\nand prey.\\'\\n\\nSo as he thought thereon this seemed to him the better way.\\nHe went up to the wood, and found it nigh the water in a\\nplace of wide prospect. So he crept beneath twin bushes\\nthat grew from one stem, both olive trees, one of them wild\\nolive. Through these the force of the wet winds blew never,\\nneither did the bright sun light on it with his rays, nor\\ncould the rain pierce through, so close were they twined\\neither to other; and thereunder crept Odysseus and anon he\\nheaped together with his hands a broad couch; for of fallen\\nleaves there was great plenty, enough to cover two or three\\nmen in winter time, however hard the weather. And the\\nsteadfast goodly Odysseus beheld it and rejoiced, and he\\nlaid him in the midst thereof and flung over him the fallen\\nleaves. And as when a man hath hidden away a brand in the\\nblack embers at an upland farm, one that hath no neighbours\\nnigh, and so saveth the seed of fire, that he may not have\\nto seek a light otherwhere, even so did Odysseus cover him\\nwith the leaves. And Athene shed sleep upon his eyes, that\\nso it might soon release him from his weary travail,\\novershadowing his eyelids.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook VI\\n\\n  Nausicaa, going to a river near that place to wash the\\n  clothes of her father, mother, and brethren, while the\\n  clothes were drying played with her maids at ball; and\\n  Odysseus coming forth is fed and clothed, and led on his\\n  way to the house of her father, King Alcinous.\\n\\nSo there he lay asleep, the steadfast goodly Odysseus,\\nfordone with toil and drowsiness. Meanwhile Athene went to\\nthe land and the city of the Phaeacians, who of old, upon a\\ntime, dwelt in spacious Hypereia; near the Cyclopes they\\ndwelt, men exceeding proud, who harried them continually,\\nbeing mightier than they. Thence the godlike Nausithous\\nmade them depart, and he carried them away, and planted\\nthem in Scheria, far off from men that live by bread. And\\nhe drew a wall around the town, and builded houses and made\\ntemples for the gods and meted out the fields. Howbeit ere\\nthis had he been stricken by fate, and had gone down to the\\nhouse of Hades, and now Alcinous was reigning, with wisdom\\ngranted by the gods. To his house went the goddess,\\ngrey-eyed Athene, devising a return for the great-hearted\\nOdysseus. She betook her to the rich-wrought bower, wherein\\nwas sleeping a maiden like to the gods in form and\\ncomeliness, Nausicaa, the daughter of Alcinous, high of\\nheart. Beside her on either hand of the pillars of the door\\nwere two handmaids, dowered with beauty from the Graces,\\nand the shining doors were shut.\\n\\nBut the goddess, fleet as the breath of the wind, swept\\ntowards the couch of the maiden, and stood above her head,\\nand spake to her in the semblance of the daughter of a\\nfamous seafarer, Dymas, a girl of like age with Nausicaa,\\nwho had found grace in her sight. In her shape the\\ngrey-eyed Athene spake to the princess, saying:\\n\\n\\'Nausicaa, how hath thy mother so heedless a maiden to her\\ndaughter? Lo, thou hast shining raiment that lies by thee\\nuncared for, and thy marriage day is near at hand, when\\nthou thyself must needs go beautifully clad, and have\\ngarments to give to them who shall lead thee to the house\\nof the bridegroom! And, behold, these are the things whence\\na good report goes abroad among men, wherein a father and\\nlady mother take delight. But come, let us arise and go\\na-washing with the breaking of the day, and I will follow\\nwith thee to be thy mate in the toil, that without delay\\nthou mayst get thee ready, since truly thou art not long to\\nbe a maiden. Lo, already they are wooing thee, the noblest\\nyouths of all the Phaeacians, among that people whence thou\\nthyself dost draw thy lineage. So come, beseech thy noble\\nfather betimes in the morning to furnish thee with mules\\nand a wain to carry the men\\'s raiment, and the robes, and\\nthe shining coverlets. Yea and for thyself it is seemlier\\nfar to go thus than on foot, for the places where we must\\nwash are a great way off the town.\\'\\n\\nSo spake the grey-eyed Athene, and departed to Olympus,\\nwhere, as they say, is the seat of the gods that standeth\\nfast for ever. Not by winds is it shaken, nor ever wet with\\nrain, nor doth the snow come nigh thereto, but most clear\\nair is spread about it cloudless, and the white light\\nfloats over it. Therein the blessed gods are glad for all\\ntheir days, and thither Athene went when she had shown\\nforth all to the maiden.\\n\\nAnon came the throned Dawn, and awakened Nausicaa of the\\nfair robes, who straightway marvelled on the dream, and\\nwent through the halls to tell her parents, her father dear\\nand her mother. And she found them within, her mother\\nsitting by the hearth with the women her handmaids,\\nspinning yarn of sea-purple stain, but her father she met\\nas he was going forth to the renowned kings in their\\ncouncil, whither the noble Phaeacians called him. Standing\\nclose by her dear father she spake, saying: \\'Father, dear,\\ncouldst thou not lend me a high waggon with strong wheels,\\nthat I may take the goodly raiment to the river to wash, so\\nmuch as I have lying soiled? Yea and it is seemly that thou\\nthyself, when thou art with the princes in council,\\nshouldest have fresh raiment to wear. Also, there are five\\ndear sons of thine in the halls, two married, but three are\\nlusty bachelors, and these are always eager for new-washen\\ngarments wherein to go to the dances; for all these things\\nhave I taken thought.\\'\\n\\nThis she said, because she was ashamed to speak of glad\\nmarriage to her father; but he saw all and answered,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Neither the mules nor aught else do I grudge thee, my\\nchild. Go thy ways, and the thralls shall get thee ready a\\nhigh waggon with good wheels, and fitted with an upper\\nframe.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he called to his men, and they gave ear, and\\nwithout the palace they made ready the smooth-running\\nmule-wain, and led the mules beneath the yoke, and\\nharnessed them under the car, while the maiden brought\\nforth from her bower the shining raiment. This she stored\\nin the polished car, and her mother filled a basket with\\nall manner of food to the heart\\'s desire, dainties too she\\nset therein, and she poured wine into a goat-skin bottle,\\nwhile Nausicaa climbed into the wain. And her mother gave\\nher soft olive oil also in a golden cruse, that she and her\\nmaidens might anoint themselves after the bath. Then\\nNausicaa took the whip and the shining reins, and touched\\nthe mules to start them; then there was a clatter of hoofs,\\nand on they strained without flagging, with their load of\\nthe raiment and the maiden. Not alone did she go, for her\\nattendants followed with her.\\n\\nNow when they were come to the beautiful stream of the\\nriver, where truly were the unfailing cisterns, and bright\\nwater welled up free from beneath, and flowed past, enough\\nto wash the foulest garments clean, there the girls\\nunharnessed the mules from under the chariot, and turning\\nthem loose they drove them along the banks of the eddying\\nriver to graze on the honey-sweet clover. Then they took\\nthe garments from the wain, in their hands, and bore them\\nto the black water, and briskly trod them down in the\\ntrenches, in busy rivalry. Now when they had washed and\\ncleansed all the stains, they spread all out in order along\\nthe shore of the deep, even where the sea, in beating on\\nthe coast, washed the pebbles clean. Then having bathed and\\nanointed them well with olive oil, they took their mid-day\\nmeal on the river\\'s banks, waiting till the clothes should\\ndry in the brightness of the sun. Anon, when they were\\nsatisfied with food, the maidens and the princess, they\\nfell to playing at ball, casting away their tires, and\\namong them Nausicaa of the white arms began the song. And\\neven as Artemis, the archer, moveth down the mountain,\\neither along the ridges of lofty Taygetus or Erymanthus,\\ntaking her pastime in the chase of boars and swift deer,\\nand with her the wild wood-nymphs disport them, the\\ndaughters of Zeus, lord of the aegis, and Leto is glad at\\nheart, while high over all she rears her head and brows,\\nand easily may she be known,--but all are fair; even so the\\ngirl unwed outshone her maiden company.\\n\\nBut when now she was about going homewards, after yoking\\nthe mules and folding up the goodly raiment, then grey-eyed\\nAthene turned to other thoughts, that so Odysseus might\\nawake, and see the lovely maiden, who should be his guide\\nto the city of the Phaeacian men. So then the princess\\nthrew the ball at one of her company; she missed the girl,\\nand cast the ball into the deep eddying current, whereat\\nthey all raised a piercing cry. Then the goodly Odysseus\\nawoke and sat up, pondering in his heart and spirit:\\n\\n\\'Woe is me! to what men\\'s land am I come now? say, are they\\nfroward, and wild, and unjust, or are they hospitable, and\\nof God-fearing mind? How shrill a cry of maidens rings\\nround me, of the nymphs that hold the steep hill-tops, and\\nthe river-springs, and the grassy water meadows! It must\\nbe, methinks, that I am near men of human speech. Go to, I\\nmyself will make trial and see.\\'\\n\\nTherewith the goodly Odysseus crept out from under the\\ncoppice, having broken with his strong hand a leafy bough\\nfrom the thick wood, to hold athwart his body, that it\\nmight hide his nakedness withal. And forth he sallied like\\na lion mountain-bred, trusting in his strength, who fares\\nout blown and rained upon, with flaming eyes; amid the kine\\nhe goes or amid the sheep or in the track of the wild deer;\\nyea, his belly bids him go even to the good homestead to\\nmake assay upon the flocks. Even so Odysseus was fain to\\ndraw nigh to the fair-tressed maidens, all naked as he was,\\nsuch need had come upon him. But he was terrible in their\\neyes, being marred with the salt sea foam, and they fled\\ncowering here and there about the jutting spits of shore.\\nAnd the daughter of Alcinous alone stood firm, for Athene\\ngave her courage of heart, and took all trembling from her\\nlimbs. So she halted and stood over against him, and\\nOdysseus considered whether he should clasp the knees of\\nthe lovely maiden, and so make his prayer, or should stand\\nas he was, apart, and beseech her with smooth words, if\\nhaply she might show him the town, and give him raiment.\\nAnd as he thought within himself, it seemed better to stand\\napart, and beseech her with smooth words, lest the maiden\\nshould be angered with him if he touched her knees: so\\nstraightway he spake a sweet and cunning word:\\n\\n\\'I supplicate thee, O queen, whether thou art a goddess or\\na mortal! If indeed thou art a goddess of them that keep\\nthe wide heaven; to Artemis, then, the daughter of great\\nZeus, I mainly liken thee, for beauty and stature and\\nshapeliness. But if thou art one of the daughters of men\\nwho dwell on earth, thrice blessed are thy father and thy\\nlady mother, and thrice blessed thy brethren. Surely their\\nsouls ever glow with gladness for thy sake, each time they\\nsee thee entering the dance, so fair a flower of maidens.\\nBut he is of heart the most blessed beyond all other who\\nshall prevail with gifts of wooing, and lead thee to his\\nhome. Never have mine eyes beheld such an one among\\nmortals, neither man nor woman; great awe comes upon me as\\nI look on thee. Yet in Delos once I saw as goodly a thing:\\na young sapling of a palm tree springing by the altar of\\nApollo. For thither too I went, and much people with me, on\\nthat path where my sore troubles were to be. Yea, and when\\nI looked thereupon, long time I marvelled in spirit,--for\\nnever grew there yet so goodly a shoot from ground,--even\\nin such wise as I wonder at thee, lady, and am astonied and\\ndo greatly fear to touch thy knees, though grievous sorrow\\nis upon me. Yesterday, on the twentieth day, I escaped from\\nthe wine-dark deep, but all that time continually the wave\\nbare me, and the vehement winds drave, from the isle\\nOgygia. And now some god has cast me on this shore, that\\nhere too, methinks, some evil may betide me; for I trow not\\nthat trouble will cease; the gods ere that time will yet\\nbring many a thing to pass. But, queen, have pity on me,\\nfor after many trials and sore to thee first of all am I\\ncome, and of the other folk, who hold this city and land, I\\nknow no man. Nay show me the town, give me an old garment\\nto cast about me, if thou hadst, when thou camest here, any\\nwrap for the linen. And may the gods grant thee all thy\\nheart\\'s desire: a husband and a home, and a mind at one\\nwith his may they give--a good gift, for there is nothing\\nmightier and nobler than when man and wife are of one heart\\nand mind in a house, a grief to their foes, and to their\\nfriends great joy, but their own hearts know it best.\\'\\n\\nThen Nausicaa of the white arms answered him, and said:\\n\\'Stranger, forasmuch as thou seemest no evil man nor\\nfoolish--and it is Olympian Zeus himself that giveth weal\\nto men, to the good and to the evil, to each one as he\\nwill, and this thy lot doubtless is of him, and so thou\\nmust in anywise endure it:--and now, since thou hast come\\nto our city and our land, thou shalt not lack raiment, nor\\naught else that is the due of a hapless suppliant, when he\\nhas met them who can befriend him. And I will show thee the\\ntown, and name the name of the people. The Phaeacians hold\\nthis city and land, and I am the daughter of Alcinous,\\ngreat of heart, on whom all the might and force of the\\nPhaeacians depend.\\'\\n\\nThus she spake, and called to her maidens of the fair\\ntresses: \\'Halt, my maidens, whither flee ye at the sight of\\na man? Ye surely do not take him for an enemy? That mortal\\nbreathes not, and never will be born, who shall come with\\nwar to the land of the Phaeacians, for they are very dear\\nto the gods. Far apart we live in the wash of the waves,\\nthe outermost of men, and no other mortals are conversant\\nwith us. Nay, but this man is some helpless one come hither\\nin his wanderings, whom now we must kindly entreat, for all\\nstrangers and beggars are from Zeus, and a little gift is\\ndear. So, my maidens, give the stranger meat and drink, and\\nbathe him in the river, where withal is a shelter from the\\nwinds.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake, but they had halted and called each to the\\nother, and they brought Odysseus to the sheltered place,\\nand made him sit down, as Nausicaa bade them, the daughter\\nof Alcinous, high of heart. Beside him they laid a mantle,\\nand a doublet for raiment, and gave him soft olive oil in\\nthe golden cruse, and bade him wash in the streams of the\\nriver. Then goodly Odysseus spake among the maidens,\\nsaying: \\'I pray you stand thus apart, while I myself wash\\nthe brine from my shoulders, and anoint me with olive oil,\\nfor truly oil is long a stranger to my skin. But in your\\nsight I will not bathe, for I am ashamed to make me naked\\nin the company of fair-tressed maidens.\\'\\n\\nThen they went apart and told all to their lady. But with\\nthe river water the goodly Odysseus washed from his skin\\nthe salt scurf that covered his back and broad shoulders,\\nand from his head he wiped the crusted brine of the barren\\nsea. But when he had washed his whole body, and anointed\\nhim with olive oil, and had clad himself in the raiment\\nthat the unwedded maiden gave him, then Athene, the\\ndaughter of Zeus, made him greater and more mighty to\\nbehold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to\\nflow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful\\nman overlays gold upon silver--one that Hephaestus and\\nPallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of\\ngrace is his handiwork--even so did Athene shed grace about\\nhis head and shoulders.\\n\\nThen to the shore of the sea went Odysseus apart, and sat\\ndown, glowing in beauty and grace, and the princess\\nmarvelled at him, and spake among her fair-tressed maidens,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Listen, my white-armed maidens, and I will say somewhat.\\nNot without the will of all the gods who hold Olympus hath\\nthis man come among the godlike Phaeacians. Erewhile he\\nseemed to me uncomely, but now he is like the gods that\\nkeep the wide heaven. Would that such an one might be\\ncalled my husband, dwelling here, and that it might please\\nhim here to abide! But come, my maidens, give the stranger\\nmeat and drink.\\'\\n\\nThus she spake, and they gave ready ear and hearkened, and\\nset beside Odysseus meat and drink, and the steadfast\\ngoodly Odysseus did eat and drink eagerly, for it was long\\nsince he had tasted food.\\n\\nNow Nausicaa of the white arms had another thought. She\\nfolded the raiment and stored it in the goodly wain, and\\nyoked the mules strong of hoof, and herself climbed into\\nthe car. Then she called on Odysseus, and spake and hailed\\nhim: \\'Up now, stranger, and rouse thee to go to the city,\\nthat I may convey thee to the house of my wise father,\\nwhere, I promise thee, thou shalt get knowledge of all the\\nnoblest of the Phaeacians. But do thou even as I tell thee,\\nand thou seemest a discreet man enough. So long as we are\\npassing along the fields and farms of men, do thou fare\\nquickly with the maidens behind the mules and the chariot,\\nand I will lead the way. But when we set foot within the\\ncity,--whereby goes a high wall with towers, and there is a\\nfair haven on either side of the town, and narrow is the\\nentrance, and curved ships are drawn up on either hand of\\nthe mole, for all the folk have stations for their vessels,\\neach man one for himself. And there is the place of\\nassembly about the goodly temple of Poseidon, furnished\\nwith heavy stones, deep bedded in the earth. There men look\\nto the gear of the black ships, hawsers and sails, and\\nthere they fine down the oars. For the Phaeacians care not\\nfor bow nor quiver, but for masts, and oars of ships, and\\ngallant barques, wherein rejoicing they cross the grey sea.\\nTheir ungracious speech it is that I would avoid, lest some\\nman afterward rebuke me, and there are but too many\\ninsolent folk among the people. And some one of the baser\\nsort might meet me and say: \"Who is this that goes with\\nNausicaa, this tall and goodly stranger? Where found she\\nhim? Her husband he will be, her very own. Either she has\\ntaken in some shipwrecked wanderer of strange men,--for no\\nmen dwell near us; or some god has come in answer to her\\ninstant prayer; from heaven has he descended, and will have\\nher to wife for evermore. Better so, if herself she has\\nranged abroad and found a lord from a strange land, for\\nverily she holds in no regard the Phaeacians here in this\\ncountry, the many men and noble who are her wooers.\" So\\nwill they speak, and this would turn to my reproach. Yea,\\nand I myself would think it blame of another maiden who did\\nsuch things in despite of her friends, her father and\\nmother being still alive, and was conversant with men\\nbefore the day of open wedlock. But, stranger, heed well\\nwhat I say, that as soon as may be thou mayest gain at my\\nfather\\'s hands an escort and a safe return. Thou shalt find\\na fair grove of Athene, a poplar grove near the road, and a\\nspring wells forth therein, and a meadow lies all around.\\nThere is my father\\'s demesne, and his fruitful close,\\nwithin the sound of a man\\'s shout from the city. Sit thee\\ndown there and wait until such time as we may have come\\ninto the city, and reached the house of my father. But when\\nthou deemest that we are got to the palace, then go up to\\nthe city of the Phaeacians, and ask for the house of my\\nfather Alcinous, high of heart. It is easily known, and a\\nyoung child could be thy guide, for nowise like it are\\nbuilded the houses of the Phaeacians, so goodly is the\\npalace of the hero Alcinous. But when thou art within the\\nshadow of the halls and the court, pass quickly through the\\ngreat chamber, till thou comest to my mother, who sits at\\nthe hearth in the light of the fire, weaving yarn of\\nsea-purple stain, a wonder to behold. Her chair is leaned\\nagainst a pillar, and her maidens sit behind her. And there\\nmy father\\'s throne leans close to hers, wherein he sits and\\ndrinks his wine, like an immortal. Pass thou by him, and\\ncast thy hands about my mother\\'s knees, that thou mayest\\nsee quickly and with joy the day of thy returning, even if\\nthou art from a very far country. If but her heart be\\nkindly disposed toward thee, then is there hope that thou\\nshalt see thy friends, and come to thy well-builded house,\\nand to thine own country.\\'\\n\\nShe spake, and smote the mules with the shining whip, and\\nquickly they left behind them the streams of the river. And\\nwell they trotted and well they paced, and she took heed to\\ndrive in such wise that the maidens and Odysseus might\\nfollow on foot, and cunningly she plied the lash. Then the\\nsun set, and they came to the famous grove, the sacred\\nplace of Athene; so there the goodly Odysseus sat him down.\\nThen straightway he prayed to the daughter of mighty Zeus:\\n\\'Listen to me, child of Zeus, lord of the aegis, unwearied\\nmaiden; hear me even now, since before thou heardest not\\nwhen I was smitten on the sea, when the renowned\\nEarth-shaker smote me. Grant me to come to the Phaeacians\\nas one dear, and worthy of pity.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him; but she\\ndid not yet appear to him face to face, for she had regard\\nunto her father\\'s brother, who furiously raged against the\\ngodlike Odysseus, till he should come to his own country.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook VII\\n\\n  Odysseus being received at the house of the king Alcinous,\\n  the queen after supper, taking notice of his garments,\\n  gives him occasion to relate his passage thither on the\\n  raft. Alcinous promises him a convoy for the morrow.\\n\\nSo he prayed there, the steadfast goodly Odysseus, while\\nthe two strong mules bare the princess to the town. And\\nwhen she had now come to the famous palace of her father,\\nshe halted at the gateway, and round her gathered her\\nbrothers, men like to the immortals, and they loosed the\\nmules from under the car, and carried the raiment within.\\nBut the maiden betook her to her chamber; and an aged dame\\nfrom Aperaea kindled the fire for her, Eurymedusa, the\\nhandmaid of the chamber, whom the curved ships upon a time\\nhad brought from Aperaea; and men chose her as a prize for\\nAlcinous, seeing that he bare rule over all the Phaeacians,\\nand the people hearkened to him as to a god. She waited on\\nthe white-armed Nausicaa in the palace halls; she was wont\\nto kindle the fire and prepare the supper in the inner\\nchamber.\\n\\nAt that same hour Odysseus roused him to go to the city,\\nand Athene shed a deep mist about Odysseus for the favour\\nthat she bare him, lest any of the Phaeacians, high of\\nheart, should meet him and mock him in sharp speech, and\\nask him who he was. But when he was now about to enter the\\npleasant city, then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, met him,\\nin the fashion of a young maiden carrying a pitcher, and\\nshe stood over against him, and goodly Odysseus inquired of\\nher:\\n\\n\\'My child, couldst thou not lead me to the palace of the\\nlord Alcinous, who bears sway among this people? Lo, I am\\ncome here, a stranger travel-worn from afar, from a distant\\nland; wherefore of the folk who possess this city and\\ncountry I know not any man.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him saying:\\n\\'Yea now, father and stranger, I will show thee the house\\nthat thou bidst me declare, for it lies near the palace of\\nmy noble father; behold, be silent as thou goest, and I\\nwill lead the way. And look on no man, nor question any.\\nFor these men do not gladly suffer strangers, nor lovingly\\nentreat whoso cometh from a strange land. They trust to the\\nspeed of their swift ships, wherewith they cross the great\\ngulf, for the Earth-shaker hath vouchsafed them this power.\\nTheir ships are swift as the flight of a bird, or as a\\nthought.\\'\\n\\nTherewith Pallas Athene led the way swiftly, and he\\nfollowed hard in the footsteps of the goddess. And it came\\nto pass that the Phaeacians, mariners renowned, marked him\\nnot as he went down the city through their midst, for the\\nfair tressed Athene suffered it not, that awful goddess,\\nwho shed a wondrous mist about him, for the favour that she\\nbare him in her heart. And Odysseus marvelled at the havens\\nand the gallant ships, yea and the places of assembly of\\nthe heroes, and the long high walls crowned with palisades,\\na marvel to behold. But when they had now come to the\\nfamous palace of the king, the goddess, grey-eyed Athene,\\nspake first and said:\\n\\n\\'Lo, here, father and stranger, is the house that thou\\nwouldst have me show thee: and thou shalt find kings at the\\nfeast, the fosterlings of Zeus; enter then, and fear not in\\nthine heart, for the dauntless man is the best in every\\nadventure, even though he come from a strange land. Thou\\nshalt find the queen first in the halls; Arete is the name\\nwhereby men call her, and she came even of those that begat\\nthe king Alcinous. First Nausithous was son of Poseidon,\\nthe Earth-shaker, and of Periboea, the comeliest of women,\\nyoungest daughter of great-hearted Eurymedon, who once was\\nking among the haughty Giants. Howbeit, he destroyed his\\ninfatuate people, and was himself destroyed; but Poseidon\\nlay with Periboea and begat a son, proud Nausithous, who\\nsometime was prince among the Phaeacians; and Nausithous\\nbegat Rhexenor and Alcinous. While Rhexenor had as yet no\\nson, Apollo of the silver bow smote him, a groom new wed,\\nleaving in his halls one only child Arete; and Alcinous\\ntook her to wife, and honoured her as no other woman in the\\nworld is honoured, of all that now-a-days keep house under\\nthe hand of their lords. Thus she hath, and hath ever had,\\nall worship heartily from her dear children and from her\\nlord Alcinous and from all the folk, who look on her as on\\na goddess, and greet her with reverend speech, when she\\ngoes about the town. Yea, for she too hath no lack of\\nunderstanding. To whomso she shows favour, even if they be\\nmen, she ends their feuds. {*} If but her heart be kindly\\ndisposed to thee, then is there good hope that thou mayest\\nsee thy friends, and come to thy high-roofed home and thine\\nown country.\\'\\n\\n{* And for the women she favours, she ends the feuds of\\ntheir lords also.}\\n\\nTherewith grey-eyed Athene departed over the unharvested\\nseas, and left pleasant Scheria, and came to Marathon and\\nwide-wayed Athens, and entered the good house of\\nErechtheus. Meanwhile Odysseus went to the famous palace of\\nAlcinous, and his heart was full of many thoughts as he\\nstood there or ever he had reached the threshold of bronze.\\nFor there was a gleam as it were of sun or moon through the\\nhigh-roofed hall of great-hearted Alcinous. Brazen were the\\nwalls which ran this way and that from the threshold to the\\ninmost chamber, and round them was a frieze of blue, and\\ngolden were the doors that closed in the good house. Silver\\nwere the door-posts that were set on the brazen threshold,\\nand silver the lintel thereupon, and the hook of the door\\nwas of gold. And on either side stood golden hounds and\\nsilver, which Hephaestus wrought by his cunning, to guard\\nthe palace of great-hearted Alcinous, being free from death\\nand age all their days. And within were seats arrayed\\nagainst the wall this way and that, from the threshold even\\nto the inmost chamber, and thereon were spread light\\ncoverings finely woven, the handiwork of women. There the\\nPhaeacian chieftains were wont to sit eating and drinking,\\nfor they had continual store. Yea, and there were youths\\nfashioned in gold, standing on firm-set bases, with flaming\\ntorches in their hands, giving light through the night to\\nthe feasters in the palace. And he had fifty handmaids in\\nthe house, and some grind the yellow grain on the\\nmillstone, and others weave webs and turn the yarn as they\\nsit, restless as the leaves of the tall poplar tree: and\\nthe soft olive oil drops off that linen, so closely is it\\nwoven. For as the Phaeacian men are skilled beyond all\\nothers in driving a swift ship upon the deep, even so are\\nthe women the most cunning at the loom, for Athene hath\\ngiven them notable wisdom in all fair handiwork and cunning\\nwit. And without the courtyard hard by the door is a great\\ngarden, off our ploughgates, and a hedge runs round on\\neither side. And there grow tall trees blossoming,\\npear-trees and pomegranates, and apple-trees with bright\\nfruit, and sweet figs, and olives in their bloom. The fruit\\nof these trees never perisheth neither faileth, winter nor\\nsummer, enduring through all the year. Evermore the West\\nWind blowing brings some fruits to birth and ripens others.\\nPear upon pear waxes old, and apple on apple, yea and\\ncluster ripens upon cluster of the grape, and fig upon fig.\\nThere too hath he a fruitful vineyard planted, whereof the\\none part is being dried by the heat, a sunny plot on level\\nground, while other grapes men are gathering, and yet\\nothers they are treading in the wine-press. In the foremost\\nrow are unripe grapes that cast the blossom, and others\\nthere be that are growing black to vintaging. There too,\\nskirting the furthest line, are all manner of garden beds,\\nplanted trimly, that are perpetually fresh, and therein are\\ntwo fountains of water, whereof one scatters his streams\\nall about the garden, and the other runs over against it\\nbeneath the threshold of the courtyard, and issues by the\\nlofty house, and thence did the townsfolk draw water. These\\nwere the splendid gifts of the gods in the palace of\\nAlcinous.\\n\\nThere the steadfast goodly Odysseus stood and gazed. But\\nwhen he had gazed at all and wondered, he passed quickly\\nover the threshold within the house. And he found the\\ncaptains and the counsellors of the Phaeacians pouring\\nforth wine to the keen-sighted god, the slayer of Argos;\\nfor to him they poured the last cup when they were minded\\nto take rest. Now the steadfast goodly Odysseus went\\nthrough the hall, clad in a thick mist, which Athene shed\\naround him, till he came to Arete and the king Alcinous.\\nAnd Odysseus cast his hands about the knees of Arete, and\\nthen it was that the wondrous mist melted from off him, and\\na silence fell on them that were within the house at the\\nsight of him, and they marvelled as they beheld him. Then\\nOdysseus began his prayer:\\n\\n\\'Arete, daughter of god-like Rhexenor, after many toils am\\nI come to thy husband and to thy knees and to these guests,\\nand may the gods vouchsafe them a happy life, and may each\\none leave to his children after him his substance in his\\nhalls and whatever dues of honour the people have rendered\\nunto him. But speed, I pray you, my parting, that I may\\ncome the more quickly to mine own country, for already too\\nlong do I suffer affliction far from my friends.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he sat him down by the hearth in the ashes at the\\nfire, and behold, a dead silence fell on all. And at the\\nlast the ancient lord Echeneus spake among them, an elder\\nof the Phaeacians, excellent in speech and skilled in much\\nwisdom of old time. With good will he made harangue and\\nspake among them:\\n\\n\\'Alcinous, this truly is not the more seemly way, nor is it\\nfitting that the stranger should sit upon the ground in the\\nashes by the hearth, while these men refrain them, waiting\\nthy word. Nay come, bid the stranger arise, and set him on\\na chair inlaid with silver, and command the henchmen to mix\\nthe wine, that we may pour forth likewise before Zeus,\\nwhose joy is in the thunder, who attendeth upon reverend\\nsuppliants. And let the housewife give supper to the\\nstranger out of such stores as be within.\\'\\n\\nNow when the mighty king Alcinous heard this saying, he\\ntook Odysseus, the wise and crafty, by the hand, and raised\\nhim from the hearth, and set him on a shining chair, whence\\nhe bade his son give place, valiant Laodamas, who sat next\\nhim and was his dearest. And a handmaid bare water for the\\nhands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured it forth over a\\nsilver basin to wash withal, and drew to his side a\\npolished table. And a grave dame bare wheaten bread and set\\nit by him and laid upon the board many dainties, giving\\nfreely of such things as she had by her. So the steadfast\\ngoodly Odysseus did eat and drink: and then the mighty\\nAlcinous spake unto the henchman:\\n\\n\\'Pontonous, mix the bowl and serve out the wine to all in\\nthe hall, that we may pour forth likewise before Zeus,\\nwhose joy is in the thunder, who attendeth upon reverend\\nsuppliants.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and Pontonous mixed the honey-hearted wine,\\nand served it out to all, when he had poured for libation\\ninto each cup in turn. But when they had poured forth and\\nhad drunken to their heart\\'s content, Alcinous made\\nharangue and spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Hear me, ye captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians,\\nthat I may speak as my spirit bids me. Now that the feast\\nis over, go ye home and lie down to rest; and in the\\nmorning we will call yet more elders together, and\\nentertain the stranger in the halls and do fair sacrifice\\nto the gods, and thereafter we will likewise bethink us of\\nthe convoy, that so without pain or grief yonder stranger\\nmay by our convoy reach his own country speedily and with\\njoy, even though he be from very far away. So shall he\\nsuffer no hurt or harm in mid passage, ere he set foot on\\nhis own land; but thereafter he shall endure such things as\\nFate and the stern spinning women drew off the spindles for\\nhim at his birth when his mother bare him. But if he is\\nsome deathless god come down from heaven, then do the gods\\nherein imagine some new device against us. For always\\nheretofore the gods appear manifest amongst us, whensoever\\nwe offer glorious hecatombs, and they feast by our side,\\nsitting at the same board; yea, and even if a wayfarer\\ngoing all alone has met with them, they use no disguise,\\nsince we are near of kin to them, even as are the Cyclopes\\nand the wild tribes of the Giants.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him, saying:\\n\\'Alcinous, that thought be far from thee! for I bear no\\nlikeness either in form or fashion to the deathless gods,\\nwho keep wide heaven, but to men that die. Whomsoever ye\\nknow of human kind the heaviest laden with sorrow, to them\\nmight I liken myself in my griefs. Yea, and I might tell of\\nyet other woes, even the long tale of toil that by the\\ngods\\' will I endured. But as for me, suffer me to sup,\\nafflicted as I am; for nought is there more shameless than\\na ravening belly, which biddeth a man perforce be mindful\\nof him, though one be worn and sorrowful in spirit, even as\\nI have sorrow of heart; yet evermore he biddeth me eat and\\ndrink and maketh me utterly to forget all my sufferings,\\nand commandeth me to take my fill. But do ye bestir you at\\nthe breaking of the day, that so ye may set me, hapless as\\nI am, upon my country\\'s soil, albeit after much suffering.\\nAh, and may life leave me when I have had sight of mine own\\npossessions, my thralls, and my dwelling that is great and\\nhigh!\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and they all assented thereto, and bade send\\nthe stranger on his way, for that he had spoken aright. Now\\nwhen they had poured forth and had drunken to their hearts\\'\\ncontent, they went each one to his house to lay them to\\nrest. But goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, and\\nby him sat Arete and godlike Alcinous; and the maids\\ncleared away the furniture of the feast; and white-armed\\nArete first spake among them. For she knew the mantle and\\nthe doublet, when she saw the goodly raiment that she\\nherself had wrought with the women her handmaids. So she\\nuttered her voice and spake to him winged words:\\n\\n\\'Sir, I am bold to ask thee first of this. Who art thou of\\nthe sons of men, and whence? Who gave thee this raiment?\\nDidst thou not say indeed that thou camest hither wandering\\nover the deep?\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered her, and said:\\n\\'\\'Tis hard, O queen, to tell my griefs from end to end, for\\nthat the gods of heaven have given me griefs in plenty. But\\nthis will I declare to thee, whereof thou dost question and\\ninquire. There is an isle, Ogygia, that lies far off in the\\nsea; there dwells the daughter of Atlas, crafty Calypso, of\\nthe braided tresses, an awful goddess, nor is any either of\\ngods or mortals conversant with her. Howbeit, some god\\nbrought me to her hearth, wretched man that I am, all\\nalone, for that Zeus with white bolt crushed my swift ship\\nand cleft it in the midst of the wine-dark deep. There all\\nthe rest of my good company was lost, but I clung with fast\\nembrace about the keel of the curved ship, and so was I\\nborne for nine whole days. And on the tenth dark night the\\ngods brought me nigh the isle Ogygia, where Calypso of the\\nbraided tresses dwells, an awful goddess. She took me in,\\nand with all care she cherished me and gave me sustenance,\\nand said that she would make me to know not death nor age\\nfor all my days; but never did she win my heart within me.\\nThere I abode for seven years continually, and watered with\\nmy tears the imperishable raiment that Calypso gave me. But\\nwhen the eighth year came round in his course, then at last\\nshe urged and bade me to be gone, by reason of a message\\nfrom Zeus, or it may be that her own mind was turned. So\\nshe sent me forth on a well-bound raft, and gave me\\nplenteous store, bread and sweet wine, and she clad me in\\nimperishable raiment, and sent forth a warm and gentle wind\\nto blow. For ten days and seven I sailed, traversing the\\ndeep, and on the eighteenth day the shadowy hills of your\\nland showed in sight, and my heart was glad,--wretched that\\nI was--for surely I was still to be the mate of much\\nsorrow. For Poseidon, shaker of the earth, stirred up the\\nsame, who roused against me the winds and stopped my way,\\nand made a wondrous sea to swell, nor did the wave suffer\\nme to be borne upon my raft, as I made ceaseless moan. Thus\\nthe storm winds shattered the raft, but as for me I cleft\\nmy way through the gulf yonder, till the wind bare and the\\nwater brought me nigh your coast. Then as I strove to land\\nupon the shore, the wave had overwhelmed me, dashing me\\nagainst the great rocks and a desolate place, but at length\\nI gave way and swam back, till I came to the river, where\\nthe place seemed best in mine eyes, smooth of rocks, and\\nwithal there was a shelter from the wind. And as I came out\\nI sank down, gathering to me my spirit, and immortal night\\ncame on. Then I gat me forth and away from the heaven-fed\\nriver, and laid me to sleep in the bushes and strewed\\nleaves about me, and the god shed over me infinite sleep.\\nThere among the leaves I slept, stricken at heart, all the\\nnight long, even till the morning and mid-day. And the sun\\nsank when sweet sleep let me free. And I was aware of the\\ncompany of thy daughter disporting them upon the sand, and\\nthere was she in the midst of them like unto the goddesses.\\nTo her I made my supplication, and she showed no lack of a\\ngood understanding, behaving so as thou couldst not hope\\nfor in chancing upon one so young; for the younger folk\\nlack wisdom always. She gave me bread enough and red wine,\\nand let wash me in the river and bestowed on me these\\ngarments. Herein, albeit in sore distress, have I told thee\\nall the truth.\\'\\n\\nAnd Alcinous answered again, and spake saying: \\'Sir, surely\\nthis was no right thought of my daughter, in that she\\nbrought thee not to our house with the women her handmaids,\\nthough thou didst first entreat her grace.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered, and said unto him:\\n\\'My lord, chide not, I pray thee, for this the blameless\\nmaiden. For indeed she bade me follow with her company, but\\nI would not for fear and very shame, lest perchance thine\\nheart might be clouded at the sight; for a jealous race\\nupon the earth are we, the tribes of men.\\'\\n\\nAnd Alcinous answered yet again, and spake saying: \\'Sir, my\\nheart within me is not of such temper as to have been wroth\\nwithout a cause: due measure in all things is best. Would\\nto father Zeus, and Athene, and Apollo, would that so\\ngoodly a man as thou art, and like-minded with me, thou\\nwouldst wed my daughter, and be called my son, here\\nabiding: so would I give thee house and wealth, if thou\\nwouldst stay of thine own will: but against thy will shall\\nnone of the Phaeacians keep thee: never be this\\nwell-pleasing in the eyes of father Zeus! And now I ordain\\nan escort for thee on a certain day, that thou mayst surely\\nknow, and that day the morrow. Then shalt thou lay thee\\ndown overcome by sleep, and they the while shall smite the\\ncalm waters, till thou come to thy country and thy house,\\nand whatsoever place is dear to thee, even though it be\\nmuch farther than Euboea, which certain of our men say is\\nthe farthest of lands, they who saw it, when they carried\\nRhadamanthus, of the fair hair, to visit Tityos, son of\\nGaia. Even thither they went, and accomplished the journey\\non the self-same day and won home again, and were not\\nweary. And now shalt thou know for thyself how far my ships\\nare the best, and how my young men excel at tossing the\\nsalt water with the oar-blade.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus rejoiced;\\nand then he uttered a word in prayer, and called aloud to\\nZeus: \\'Father Zeus, oh that Alcinous may fulfil all that he\\nhath said, so may his fame never be quenched upon the\\nearth, the grain-giver, and I should come to mine own\\nland!\\'\\n\\nThus they spake one to the other. And white-armed Arete\\nbade her handmaids set out bedsteads beneath the gallery,\\nand cast fair purple blankets over them, and spread\\ncoverlets above, and thereon lay thick mantles to be a\\nclothing over all. So they went from the hall with torch in\\nhand. But when they had busied them and spread the good\\nbedstead, they stood by Odysseus and called unto him,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Up now, stranger, and get thee to sleep, thy bed is made\\'\\n\\nSo spake they, and it seemed to him that rest was wondrous\\ngood. So he slept there, the steadfast goodly Odysseus, on\\nthe jointed bedstead, beneath the echoing gallery. But\\nAlcinous laid him down in the innermost chamber of the high\\nhouse, and by him the lady his wife arrayed bedstead and\\nbedding.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook VIII\\n\\n  The next day\\'s entertainment of Odysseus, where he sees\\n  them contend in wrestling and other exercises, and upon\\n  provocation took up a greater stone than that which they\\n  were throwing, and overthrew them all. Alcinous and the\\n  lords give him presents. And how the king asked his name,\\n  his country, and his adventures.\\n\\nNow when early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, then\\nthe mighty king Alcinous gat him up from his bed; and\\nOdysseus, of the seed of Zeus, likewise uprose, the waster\\nof cities. And the mighty king Alcinous led the way to the\\nassembly place of the Phaeacians, which they had\\nestablished hard by the ships. So when they had come\\nthither, and sat them down on the polished stones close by\\neach other, Pallas Athene went on her way through the town,\\nin the semblance of the herald of wise Alcinous, devising a\\nreturn for the great-hearted Odysseus. Then standing by\\neach man she spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Hither now get ye to the assembly, ye captains and\\ncounsellors of the Phaeacians, that ye may learn concerning\\nthe stranger, who hath lately come to the palace of wise\\nAlcinous, in his wanderings over the deep, and his form is\\nlike the deathless gods.\\'\\n\\nTherewith she aroused the spirit and desire of each one,\\nand speedily the meeting-places and seats were filled with\\nmen that came to the gathering: yea, and many an one\\nmarvelled at the sight of the wise son of Laertes, for\\nwondrous was the grace Athene poured upon his head and\\nshoulders, and she made him greater and more mighty to\\nbehold, that he might win love and worship and honour among\\nall the Phaeacians, and that he might accomplish many\\nfeats, wherein the Phaeacians made trial of Odysseus. Now\\nwhen they were gathered and come together, Alcinous made\\nharangue and spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Harken, ye captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians, and\\nI will say that which my spirit within me bids me utter.\\nThis stranger, I know not who he is, hath come to my house\\nin his wandering, whether from the men of the dawning or\\nthe westward, and he presses for a convoy, and prays that\\nit be assured to him. So let us, as in time past, speed on\\nthe convoy. For never, nay never, doth any man who cometh\\nto my house, abide here long in sorrow for want of help\\nupon his way. Nay, come let us draw down a black ship to\\nthe fair salt sea, for her first voyage, and let them\\nchoose fifty and two noble youths throughout the township,\\nwho have been proved heretofore the best. And when ye have\\nmade fast the oars upon the benches, step all a shore, and\\nthereafter come to our house, and quickly fall to feasting;\\nand I will make good provision for all. To the noble youths\\nI give this commandment; but ye others, sceptred kings,\\ncome to my fair dwelling, that we may entertain the\\nstranger in the halls, and let no man make excuse.\\nMoreover, bid hither the divine minstrel, Demodocus, for\\nthe god hath given minstrelsy to him as to none other, to\\nmake men glad in what way soever his spirit stirs him to\\nsing.\\'\\n\\nHe spake and led the way, and the sceptred kings\\naccompanied him, while the henchmen went for the divine\\nminstrel. And chosen youths, fifty and two, departed at his\\ncommand, to the shore of the unharvested sea. But after\\nthey had gone down to the ship and to the sea, first of all\\nthey drew the ship down to the deep water, and placed the\\nmast and sails in the black ship, and fixed the oars in\\nleathern loops, all orderly, and spread forth the white\\nsails. And they moored her high out in the shore water, and\\nthereafter went on their way to the great palace of the\\nwise Alcinous. Now the galleries and the courts and the\\nrooms were thronged with men that came to the gathering,\\nfor there were many, young and old. Then Alcinous\\nsacrificed twelve sheep among them, and eight boars with\\nflashing tusks, and two oxen with trailing feet. These they\\nflayed and made ready, and dressed a goodly feast.\\n\\nThen the henchman drew near, leading with him the beloved\\nminstrel, whom the muse loved dearly, and she gave him both\\ngood and evil; of his sight she reft him, but granted him\\nsweet song. Then Pontonous, the henchman, set for him a\\nhigh chair inlaid with silver, in the midst of the guests,\\nleaning it against the tall pillar, and he hung the loud\\nlyre on a pin, close above his head, and showed him how to\\nlay his hands on it. And close by him he placed a basket,\\nand a fair table, and a goblet of wine by his side, to\\ndrink when his spirit bade him. So they stretched forth\\ntheir hands upon the good cheer spread before them. But\\nafter they had put from them the desire of meat and drink,\\nthe Muse stirred the minstrel to sing the songs of famous\\nmen, even that lay whereof the fame had then reached the\\nwide heaven, namely, the quarrel between Odysseus and\\nAchilles, son of Peleus; how once on a time they contended\\nin fierce words at a rich festival of the gods, but\\nAgamemnon, king of men, was inly glad when the noblest of\\nthe Achaeans fell at variance. For so Phoebus Apollo in his\\nsoothsaying had told him that it must be, in goodly Pytho,\\nwhat time he crossed the threshold of stone, to seek to the\\noracle. For in those days the first wave of woe was rolling\\non Trojans and Danaans through the counsel of great Zeus.\\n\\nThis song it was that the famous minstrel sang; but\\nOdysseus caught his great purple cloak with his stalwart\\nhands, and drew it down over his head, and hid his comely\\nface, for he was ashamed to shed tears beneath his brows in\\npresence of the Phaeacians. Yea, and oft as the divine\\nminstrel paused in his song, Odysseus would wipe away the\\ntears, and draw the cloak from off his head, and take the\\ntwo-handled goblet and pour forth before the gods. But\\nwhensoever he began again, and the chiefs of the Phaeacians\\nstirred him to sing, in delight at the lay, again would\\nOdysseus cover up his head and make moan. Now none of all\\nthe company marked him weeping, but Alcinous alone noted it\\nand was ware thereof as he sat by him and heard him\\ngroaning heavily. And presently he spake among the\\nPhaeacians, masters of the oar:\\n\\n\\'Hearken, ye captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians,\\nnow have our souls been satisfied with the good feast, and\\nwith the lyre, which is the mate of the rich banquet. Let\\nus go forth anon, and make trial of divers games, that the\\nstranger may tell his friends, when home he returneth, how\\ngreatly we excel all men in boxing, and wrestling, and\\nleaping, and speed of foot.\\'\\n\\nHe spake, and led the way, and they went with him. And the\\nhenchman hung the loud lyre on the pin, and took the hand\\nof Demodocus, and let him forth from the hall, and guided\\nhim by the same way, whereby those others, the chiefs of\\nthe Phaeacians, had gone to gaze upon the games. So they\\nwent on their way to the place of assembly, and with them a\\ngreat company innumerable; and many a noble youth stood up\\nto play. There rose Acroneus, and Ocyalus, and Elatreus,\\nand Nauteus, and Prymneus, and Anchialus, and Eretmeus, and\\nPonteus, and Proreus, Thoon, and Anabesineus, and\\nAmphialus, son of Polyneus, son of Tekton, and likewise\\nEuryalus, the peer of murderous Ares, the son of Naubolus,\\nwho in face and form was goodliest of all the Phaeacians\\nnext to noble Laodamas. And there stood up the three sons\\nof noble Alcinous, Laodamas, and Halius, and god-like\\nClytoneus. And behold, these all first tried the issue in\\nthe foot race. From the very start they strained at utmost\\nspeed: and all together they flew forward swiftly, raising\\nthe dust along the plain. And noble Clytoneus was far the\\nswiftest of them all in running, and by the length of the\\nfurrow that mules cleave in a fallow field, {*} so far did\\nhe shoot to the front, and came to the crowd by the lists,\\nwhile those others were left behind. Then they made trial\\nof strong wrestling, and here in turn Euryalus excelled all\\nthe best. And in leaping Amphialus was far the foremost,\\nand Elatreus in weight-throwing, and in boxing Laodamas,\\nthe good son of Alcinous. Now when they had all taken their\\npleasure in the games, Laodamas, son of Alcinous, spake\\namong them:\\n\\n{* The distance here indicated seems to be that which the\\nmule goes in ploughing, without pausing to take breath.}\\n\\n\\'Come, my friends, let us ask the stranger whether he is\\nskilled or practised in any sport. Ill fashioned, at least,\\nhe is not in his thighs and sinewy legs and hands withal,\\nand his stalwart neck and mighty strength: yea and he lacks\\nnot youth, but is crushed by many troubles. For I tell thee\\nthere is nought else worse than the sea to confound a man,\\nhow hardy soever he may be.\\'\\n\\nAnd Euryalus in turn made answer, and said: \\'Laodamas,\\nverily thou hast spoken this word in season. Go now thyself\\nand challenge him, and declare thy saying.\\'\\n\\nNow when the good son of Alcinous heard this, he went and\\nstood in the midst, and spake unto Odysseus: \\'Come, do thou\\ntoo, father and stranger, try thy skill in the sports, if\\nhaply thou art practised in any; and thou art like to have\\nknowledge of games, for there is no greater glory for a man\\nwhile yet he lives, than that which he achieves by hand and\\nfoot. Come, then, make essay, and cast away care from thy\\nsoul: thy journey shall not now be long delayed; lo, thy\\nship is even now drawn down to the sea, and the men of thy\\ncompany are ready.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him, saying;\\n\\'Laodamas, wherefore do ye mock me, requiring this thing of\\nme? Sorrow is far nearer my heart than sports, for much\\nhave I endured and laboured sorely in time past, and now I\\nsit in this your gathering, craving my return, and making\\nmy prayer to the king and all the people.\\'\\n\\nAnd Euryalus answered, and rebuked him to his face: \\'No\\ntruly, stranger, nor do I think thee at all like one that\\nis skilled in games, whereof there are many among men,\\nrather art thou such an one as comes and goes in a benched\\nship, a master of sailors that are merchantmen, one with a\\nmemory for his freight, or that hath the charge of a cargo\\nhomeward bound, and of greedily gotten gains; thou seemest\\nnot a man of thy hands.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on him and\\nsaid: \\'Stranger, thou hast not spoken well; thou art like a\\nman presumptuous. So true it is that the gods do not give\\nevery gracious gift to all, neither shapeliness, nor\\nwisdom, nor skilled speech. For one man is feebler than\\nanother in presence, yet the god crowns his words with\\nbeauty, and men behold him and rejoice, and his speech runs\\nsurely on his way with a sweet modesty, and he shines forth\\namong the gathering of his people, and as he passes through\\nthe town men gaze on him as a god. Another again is like\\nthe deathless gods for beauty, but his words have no crown\\nof grace about them; even as thou art in comeliness\\npre-eminent, nor could a god himself fashion thee for the\\nbetter, but in wit thou art a weakling. Yea, thou hast\\nstirred my spirit in my breast by speaking thus amiss. I am\\nnot all unversed in sports, as thy words go, but methinks I\\nwas among the foremost while as yet I trusted in my youth\\nand my hands, but now am I holden in misery and pains: for\\nI have endured much in passing through the wars of men and\\nthe grievous waves of the sea. Yet even so, for all my\\naffliction, I will essay the games, for thy word hath\\nbitten to the quick, and thou hast roused me with thy\\nsaying.\\'\\n\\nHe spake, and clad even as he was in his mantle leaped to\\nhis feet, and caught up a weight larger than the rest, a\\nhuge weight heavier far than those wherewith the Phaeacians\\ncontended in casting. With one whirl he sent it from his\\nstout hand, and the stone flew hurtling: and the\\nPhaeacians, of the long oars, those mariners renowned,\\ncrouched to earth beneath the rushing of the stone. Beyond\\nall the marks it flew, so lightly it sped from his hand,\\nand Athene in the fashion of a man marked the place, and\\nspake and hailed him:\\n\\n\\'Yea, even a blind man, stranger, might discern that token\\nif he groped for it, for it is in no wise lost among the\\nthrong of the others, but is far the first; for this bout\\nthen take heart: not one of the Phaeacians shall attain\\nthereunto or overpass it.\\'\\n\\nSo spake she; and the steadfast goodly Odysseus rejoiced\\nand was glad, for that he saw a true friend in the lists.\\nThen with a lighter heart he spake amid the Phaeacians:\\n\\n\\'Now reach ye this throw, young men, if ye may; and soon,\\nmethinks, will I cast another after it, as far or yet\\nfurther. And whomsoever of the rest his heart and spirit\\nstir thereto, hither let him come and try the issue with\\nme, in boxing or in wrestling or even in the foot race, I\\ncare not which, for ye have greatly angered me: let any of\\nall the Phaeacians come save Laodamas alone, for he is mine\\nhost: who would strive with one that entreated him kindly?\\nWitless and worthless is the man, whoso challengeth his\\nhost that receiveth him in a strange land, he doth but maim\\nhis own estate. But for the rest, I refuse none and hold\\nnone lightly, but I fain would know and prove them face to\\nface. For I am no weakling in all sports, even in the feats\\nof men. I know well how to handle the polished bow, and\\never the first would I be to shoot and smite my man in the\\npress of foes, even though many of my company stood by, and\\nwere aiming at the enemy. Alone Philoctetes in the Trojan\\nland surpassed me with the bow in our Achaean archery. But\\nI avow myself far more excellent than all besides, of the\\nmortals that are now upon the earth and live by bread. Yet\\nwith the men of old time I would not match me, neither with\\nHeracles nor with Eurytus of Oechalia, who contended even\\nwith the deathless gods for the prize of archery. Wherefore\\nthe great Eurytus perished all too soon, nor did old age\\ncome on him in his halls, for Apollo slew him in his wrath,\\nseeing that he challenged him to shoot a match. And with\\nthe spear I can throw further than any other man can shoot\\nan arrow. Only I doubt that in the foot race some of the\\nPhaeacians may outstrip me, for I have been shamefully\\nbroken in many waters, seeing that there was no continual\\nsustenance on board; wherefore my knees are loosened.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he and all kept silence; and Alcinous alone\\nanswered him, saying:\\n\\n\\'Stranger, forasmuch as these thy words are not ill-taken\\nin our gathering, but thou wouldest fain show forth the\\nvalour which keeps thee company, being angry that yonder\\nman stood by thee in the lists, and taunted thee, in such\\nsort as no mortal would speak lightly of thine excellence,\\nwho had knowledge of sound words; nay now, mark my speech;\\nso shalt thou have somewhat to tell another hero, when with\\nthy wife and children thou suppest in thy halls, and\\nrecallest our prowess, what deeds Zeus bestoweth even upon\\nus from our fathers\\' days even until now. For we are no\\nperfect boxers, nor wrestlers, but speedy runners, and the\\nbest of seamen; and dear to us ever is the banquet, and the\\nharp, and the dance, and changes of raiment, and the warm\\nbath, and love, and sleep. Lo, now arise, ye dancers of the\\nPhaeacians, the best in the land, and make sport, that so\\nthe stranger may tell his friends, when he returneth home,\\nhow far we surpass all men besides in seamanship, and speed\\nof foot, and in the dance and song. And let one go quickly,\\nand fetch for Demodocus the loud lyre which is lying\\nsomewhere in our halls.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Alcinous the godlike, and the henchman rose to\\nbear the hollow lyre from the king\\'s palace. Then stood up\\nnine chosen men in all, the judges of the people, who were\\nwont to order all things in the lists aright. So they\\nlevelled the place for the dance, and made a fair ring and\\na wide. And the henchman drew near bearing the loud lyre to\\nDemodocus, who gat him into the midst, and round him stood\\nboys in their first bloom, skilled in the dance, and they\\nsmote the good floor with their feet. And Odysseus gazed at\\nthe twinklings of the feet, and marvelled in spirit.\\n\\nNow as the minstrel touched the lyre, he lifted up his\\nvoice in sweet song, and he sang of the love of Ares and\\nAphrodite, of the fair crown, how at the first they lay\\ntogether in the house of Hephaestus privily; and Ares gave\\nher many gifts, and dishonoured the marriage bed of the\\nlord Hephaestus. And anon there came to him one to report\\nthe thing, even Helios, that had seen them at their\\npastime. Now when Hephaestus heard the bitter tidings, he\\nwent his way to the forge, devising evil in the deep of his\\nheart, and set the great anvil on the stithy, and wrought\\nfetters that none might snap or loosen, that the lovers\\nmight there unmoveably remain. Now when he had forged the\\ncrafty net in his anger against Ares, he went on his way to\\nthe chamber where his marriage bed was set out, and strewed\\nhis snares all about the posts of the bed, and many too\\nwere hung aloft from the main beam, subtle as spiders\\'\\nwebs, so that none might see them, even of the blessed\\ngods: so cunningly were they forged. Now after he had done\\nwinding the snare about the bed, he made as though he would\\ngo to Lemnos, that stablished castle, and this was far the\\ndearest of all lands in his sight. But Ares of the golden\\nrein kept no blind watch, what time he saw Hephaestus, the\\nfamed craftsman, depart afar. So he went on his way to the\\nhouse of renowned Hephaestus, eager for the love of crowned\\nCytherea. Now she was but newly come from her sire, the\\nmighty Cronion, and as it chanced had sat her down; and\\nAres entered the house, and clasped her hand, and spake,\\nand hailed her:\\n\\n\\'Come, my beloved, let us to bed, and take our pleasure of\\nlove, for Hephaestus is no longer among his own people;\\nmethinks he is already gone to Lemnos, to the Sintians, men\\nof savage speech.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and a glad thing it seemed to her to lie with\\nhim. So they twain went to the couch, and laid them to\\nsleep, and around them clung the cunning bonds of skilled\\nHephaestus, so that they could not move nor raise a limb.\\nThen at the last they knew it, when there was no way to\\nflee. Now the famous god of the strong arms drew near to\\nthem, having turned him back ere he reached the land of\\nLemnos. For Helios had kept watch, and told him all. So\\nheavy at heart he went his way to his house, and stood at\\nthe entering in of the gate, and wild rage gat hold of him,\\nand he cried terribly, and shouted to all the gods:\\n\\n\\'Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods, that live for\\never, come hither, that ye may see a mirthful thing and a\\ncruel, for that Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, ever\\ndishonours me by reason of my lameness, and sets her heart\\non Ares the destroyer, because he is fair and straight of\\nlimb, but as for me, feeble was I born. Howbeit, there is\\nnone to blame but my father and mother,--would they had\\nnever begotten me! But now shall ye see where these have\\ngone up into my bed, and sleep together in love; and I am\\ntroubled at the sight. Yet, methinks, they will not care to\\nlie thus even for a little while longer, despite their\\ngreat love. Soon will they have no desire to sleep\\ntogether, but the snare and the bond shall hold them, till\\nher sire give back to me the gifts of wooing, one and all,\\nthose that I bestowed upon him for the hand of his\\nshameless girl; for that his daughter is fair, but without\\ndiscretion.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he; and lo, the gods gathered together to the\\nhouse of the brazen floor. Poseidon came, the girdler of\\nthe earth, and Hermes came, the bringer of luck, and prince\\nApollo came, the archer. But the lady goddesses abode each\\nwithin her house for shame. So the gods, the givers of good\\nthings, stood in the porch: and laughter unquenchable arose\\namong the blessed gods, as they beheld the sleight of\\ncunning Hephaestus. And thus would one speak, looking to\\nhis neighbour:\\n\\n\\'Ill deed, ill speed! The slow catcheth the swift! Lo, how\\nHephaestus, slow as he is, hath overtaken Ares, albeit he\\nis the swiftest of the gods that hold Olympus, by his craft\\nhath he taken him despite his lameness; wherefore surely\\nAres oweth the fine of the adulterer.\\' Thus they spake one\\nto the other. But the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, spake to\\nHermes:\\n\\n\\'Hermes, son of Zeus, messenger and giver of good things,\\nwouldst thou be fain, aye, pressed by strong bonds though\\nit might be, to lie on the couch by golden Aphrodite?\\'\\n\\nThen the messenger, the slayer of Argos, answered him: \\'I\\nwould that this might be, Apollo, my prince of archery! So\\nmight thrice as many bonds innumerable encompass me about,\\nand all ye gods be looking on and all the goddesses, yet\\nwould I lie by golden Aphrodite.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and laughter rose among the deathless gods.\\nHowbeit, Poseidon laughed not, but was instant with\\nHephaestus, the renowned artificer, to loose the bonds of\\nAres: and he uttered his voice, and spake to him winged\\nwords:\\n\\n\\'Loose him, I pray thee, and I promise even as thou biddest\\nme, that he shall himself pay all fair forfeit in the\\npresence of the deathless gods.\\'\\n\\nThen the famous god of the strong arms answered him:\\n\\'Require not this of me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth.\\nEvil are evil folk\\'s pledges to hold. How could I keep thee\\nbound among the deathless gods, if Ares were to depart,\\navoiding the debt and the bond?\\'\\n\\nThen Poseidon answered him, shaker of the earth:\\n\\'Hephaestus, even if Ares avoid the debt and flee away, I\\nmyself will pay thee all.\\'\\n\\nThen the famous god of the strong arms answered him: \\'It\\nmay not be that I should say thee nay, neither is it meet.\\'\\n\\nTherewith the mighty Hephaestus loosed the bonds, and the\\ntwain, when they were freed from that strong bond, sprang\\nup straightway, and departed, he to Thrace, but\\nlaughter-loving Aphrodite went to Paphos of Cyprus, where\\nis her precinct and fragrant altar. There the Graces bathed\\nand anointed her with oil imperishable, such as is laid\\nupon the everlasting gods. And they clad her in lovely\\nraiment, a wonder to see.\\n\\nThis was the song the famous minstrel sang; and Odysseus\\nlistened and was glad at heart, and likewise did the\\nPhaeacians, of the long oars, those mariners renowned.\\n\\nThen Alcinous bade Halius and Laodamas dance alone, for\\nnone ever contended with them. So when they had taken in\\ntheir hands the goodly ball of purple hue, that cunning\\nPolybus had wrought for them, the one would bend backwards,\\nand throw it towards the shadowy clouds; and the other\\nwould leap upward from the earth, and catch it lightly in\\nhis turn, before his feet touched the ground. Now after\\nthey had made trial of throwing the ball straight up, the\\ntwain set to dance upon the bounteous earth, tossing the\\nball from hand to hand, and the other youths stood by the\\nlists and beat time, and a great din uprose.\\n\\nThen it was that goodly Odysseus spake unto Alcinous: \\'My\\nlord Alcinous, most notable among all the people, thou\\ndidst boast thy dancers to be the best in the world, and\\nlo, thy words are fulfilled; I wonder as I look on them.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and the mighty king Alcinous rejoiced and\\nspake at once among the Phaeacians, masters of the oar:\\n\\n\\'Hearken ye, captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians,\\nthis stranger seems to me a wise man enough. Come then, let\\nus give him a stranger\\'s gift, as is meet. Behold, there\\nare twelve glorious princes who rule among this people and\\nbear sway, and I myself am the thirteenth. Now each man\\namong you bring a fresh robe and a doublet, and a talent of\\nfine gold, and let us speedily carry all these gifts\\ntogether, that the stranger may take them in his hands, and\\ngo to supper with a glad heart. As for Euryalus, let him\\nyield amends to the man himself, with soft speech and with\\na gift, for his was no gentle saying.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and they all assented thereto, and would have\\nit so. And each one sent forth his henchman to fetch his\\ngift, and Euryalus answered the king and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'My lord Alcinous, most notable among all the people, I\\nwill make atonement to thy guest according to thy word. I\\nwill give him a hanger all of bronze, with a silver hilt\\nthereto, and a sheath of fresh-sawn ivory covers it about,\\nand it shall be to him a thing of price.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he puts into his hands the hanger dight with\\nsilver, and uttering his voice spake to him winged words:\\n\\'Hail, stranger and father; and if aught grievous hath been\\nspoken, may the storm-winds soon snatch and bear it away.\\nBut may the gods grant thee to see thy wife and to come to\\nthine own country, for all too long has thou endured\\naffliction away from thy friends.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: \\'Thou\\ntoo, my friend, all hail; and may the gods vouchsafe thee\\nhappiness, and mayst thou never miss this sword which thou\\nhast given me, thou that with soft speech hast yielded me\\namends.\\'\\n\\nHe spake and hung about his shoulders the silver-studded\\nsword. And the sun sank, and the noble gifts were brought\\nhim. Then the proud henchmen bare them to the palace of\\nAlcinous, and the sons of noble Alcinous took the fair\\ngifts, and set them by their reverend mother. And the\\nmighty king Alcinous led the way, and they came in and sat\\nthem down on the high seats. And the mighty Alcinous spake\\nunto Arete:\\n\\n\\'Bring me hither, my lady, a choice coffer, the best thou\\nhast, and thyself place therein a fresh robe and a doublet,\\nand heat for our guest a cauldron on the fire, and warm\\nwater, that after the bath the stranger may see all the\\ngifts duly arrayed which the noble Phaeacians bare hither,\\nand that he may have joy in the feast, and in hearing the\\nsong of the minstrelsy. Also I will give him a beautiful\\ngolden chalice of mine own, that he may be mindful of me\\nall the days of his life when he poureth the drink-offering\\nto Zeus and to the other gods.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and Arete bade her handmaids to set a great\\ncauldron on the fire with what speed they might. And they\\nset the cauldron for the filling of the bath on the blazing\\nfire, and poured water therein, and took faggots and\\nkindled them beneath. So the fire began to circle round the\\nbelly of the cauldron, and the water waxed hot. Meanwhile\\nArete brought forth for her guest the beautiful coffer from\\nthe treasure chamber, and bestowed fair gifts therein,\\nraiment and gold, which the Phaeacians gave him. And with\\nher own hands she placed therein a robe and goodly doublet,\\nand uttering her voice spake to him winged words:\\n\\n\\'Do thou now look to the lid, and quickly tie the knot,\\nlest any man spoil thy goods by the way, when presently\\nthou fallest on sweet sleep travelling in thy black ship.\\'\\n\\nNow when the steadfast goodly Odysseus heard this saying,\\nforthwith he fixed on the lid, and quickly tied the curious\\nknot, which the lady Circe on a time had taught him. Then\\nstraightway the housewife bade him go to the bath and bathe\\nhim; and he saw the warm water and was glad, for he was not\\nwont to be so cared for, from the day that he left the\\nhouse of fair-tressed Calypso, but all that while he had\\ncomfort continually as a god.\\n\\nNow after the maids had bathed him and anointed him with\\nolive oil, and had cast a fair mantle and a doublet upon\\nhim, he stept forth from the bath, and went to be with the\\nchiefs at their wine. And Nausicaa, dowered with beauty by\\nthe gods, stood by the pillar of the well-builded roof, and\\nmarvelled at Odysseus, beholding him before her eyes, and\\nshe uttered her voice and spake to him winged words:\\n\\n\\'Farewell, stranger, and even in thine own country bethink\\nthee of me upon a time, for that to me first thou owest the\\nransom of life.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying:\\n\\'Nausicaa, daughter of great-hearted Alcinous, yea, may\\nZeus, the thunderer, the lord of Here, grant me to reach my\\nhome and see the day of my returning; so would I, even\\nthere, do thee worship as to a god, all my days for\\nevermore, for thou, lady, hast given me my life.\\'\\n\\nHe spake and sat him in the high seat by king Alcinous. And\\nnow they were serving out the portions and mixing the wine.\\nThen the henchmen drew nigh leading the sweet minstrel,\\nDemodocus, that was had in honour of the people. So he set\\nhim in the midst of the feasters, and made him lean against\\na tall column. Then to the henchman spake Odysseus of many\\ncounsels, for he had cut off a portion of the chine of a\\nwhite-toothed boar, whereon yet more was left, with rich\\nfat on either side:\\n\\n\\'Lo, henchman, take this mess, and hand it to Demodocus,\\nthat he may eat, and I will bid him hail, despite my\\nsorrow. For minstrels from all men on earth get their meed\\nof honour and worship; inasmuch as the Muse teacheth them\\nthe paths of song, and loveth the tribe of minstrels.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and the henchman bare the mess, and set it\\nupon the knees of the lord Demodocus, and he took it, and\\nwas glad at heart. Then they stretched forth their hands\\nupon the good cheer set before them. Now after they had put\\nfrom them the desire of meat and drink, then Odysseus of\\nmany counsels spake to Demodocus, saying:\\n\\n\\'Demodocus, I praise thee far above all mortal men, whether\\nit be the Muse, the daughter of Zeus, that taught thee, or\\neven Apollo, for right duly dost thou chant the faring of\\nthe Achaeans, even all that they wrought and suffered, and\\nall their travail, as if, methinks, thou hadst been\\npresent, or heard the tale from another. Come now, change\\nthy strain, and sing of the fashioning of the horse of\\nwood, which Epeius made by the aid of Athene, even the\\nguileful thing, that goodly Odysseus led up into the\\ncitadel, when he had laden it with the men who wasted\\nIlios. If thou wilt indeed rehearse me this aright, so will\\nI be thy witness among all men, how the god of his grace\\nhath given thee the gift of wondrous song.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and the minstrel, being stirred by the god,\\nbegan and showed forth his minstrelsy. He took up the tale\\nwhere it tells how the Argives of the one part set fire to\\ntheir huts, and went aboard their decked ships and sailed\\naway, while those others, the fellowship of renowned\\nOdysseus, were now seated in the assembly-place of the\\nTrojans, all hidden in the horse, for the Trojans\\nthemselves had dragged him to the citadel. So the horse\\nstood there, while seated all around him the people spake\\nmany things confusedly and three ways their counsel looked;\\neither to cleave the hollow timber with the pitiless spear,\\nor to drag it to the brow of the hill, and hurl it from the\\nrocks, or to leave it as a mighty offering to appease the\\ngods. And on this wise it was to be at the last. For the\\ndoom was on them to perish when their city should have\\nclosed upon the great horse of wood, wherein sat all the\\nbravest of the Argives, bearing to the Trojans death and\\ndestiny. And he sang how the sons of the Achaeans poured\\nforth from the horse, and left the hollow lair, and sacked\\nthe burg. And he sang how and where each man wasted the\\ntown, and of Odysseus, how he went like Ares to the house\\nof Deiphobus with godlike Menelaus. It was there, he said,\\nthat Odysseus adventured the most grievous battle, and in\\nthe end prevailed, by grace of great-hearted Athene.\\n\\nThis was the song that the famous minstrel sang. But the\\nheart of Odysseus melted, and the tear wet his cheeks\\nbeneath the eyelids. And as a woman throws herself wailing\\nabout her dear lord, who hath fallen before his city and\\nthe host, warding from his town and his children the\\npitiless day; and she beholds him dying and drawing\\ndifficult breath, and embracing his body wails aloud, while\\nthe foemen behind smite her with spears on back and\\nshoulders and lead her up into bondage, to bear labour and\\ntrouble, and with the most pitiful grief her cheeks are\\nwasted; even so pitifully fell the tears beneath the brows\\nof Odysseus. Now none of all the company marked him\\nweeping; but Alcinous alone noted it, and was ware thereof,\\nas he sat nigh him and heard him groaning heavily. And\\npresently he spake among the Phaeacians, masters of the\\noar:\\n\\n\\'Hearken, ye captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians,\\nand now let Demodocus hold his hand from the loud lyre, for\\nthis song of his is nowise pleasing alike to all. From the\\ntime that we began to sup, and that the divine minstrel was\\nmoved to sing, ever since hath yonder stranger never ceased\\nfrom woeful lamentation: sore grief, methinks, hath\\nencompassed his heart. Nay, but let the minstrel cease,\\nthat we may all alike make merry, hosts and guest, since it\\nis far meeter so. For all these things are ready for the\\nsake of the honourable stranger, even the convoy and the\\nloving gifts which we give him out of our love. In a\\nbrother\\'s place stand the stranger and the suppliant, to\\nhim whose wits have even a little range, wherefore do thou\\ntoo hide not now with crafty purpose aught whereof I ask\\nthee; it were more meet for thee to tell it out. Say, what\\nis the name whereby they called thee at home, even thy\\nfather and thy mother, and others thy townsmen and the\\ndwellers round about? For there is none of all mankind\\nnameless, neither the mean man nor yet the noble, from the\\nfirst hour of his birth, but parents bestow a name on every\\nman so soon as he is born. Tell me too of thy land, thy\\ntownship, and thy city, that our ships may conceive of\\ntheir course to bring thee thither. For the Phaeacians have\\nno pilots nor any rudders after the manner of other ships,\\nbut their barques themselves understand the thoughts and\\nintents of men; they know the cities and fat fields of\\nevery people, and most swiftly they traverse the gulf of\\nthe salt sea, shrouded in mist and cloud, and never do they\\ngo in fear of wreck or ruin. Howbeit I heard upon a time\\nthis word thus spoken by my father Nausithous, who was wont\\nto say that Poseidon was jealous of us for that we give\\nsafe escort to all men. He said that the god would some day\\nsmite a well-wrought ship of the Phaeacians as she came\\nhome from a convoy over the misty deep, and would\\novershadow our city with a great mountain. Thus that\\nancient one would speak, and thus the god may bring it\\nabout, or leave it undone, according to the good pleasure\\nof his will. But come now, declare me this and plainly tell\\nit all; whither wast thou borne wandering, and to what\\nshores of men thou camest; tell me of the people and of\\ntheir fair-lying cities, of those whoso are hard and wild\\nand unjust, and of those likewise who are hospitable and of\\na god-fearing mind. Declare, too, wherefore thou dost weep\\nand mourn in spirit at the tale of the faring of the Argive\\nDanaans and the lay of Ilios. All this the gods have\\nfashioned, and have woven the skein of death for men, that\\nthere might be a song in the ears even of the folk of\\naftertime. Hadst thou even a kinsman by marriage that fell\\nbefore Ilios, a true man, a daughter\\'s husband or wife\\'s\\nfather, such as are nearest us after those of our own stock\\nand blood? Or else, may be, some loving friend, a good man\\nand true; for a friend with an understanding heart is no\\nwhit worse than a brother.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nBook IX\\n\\n  Odysseus relates, first, what befell him amongst the\\n  Cicones at Ismarus; secondly, amongst the Lotophagi;\\n  thirdly, how he was used by the Cyclops Polyphemus.\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: \\'King\\nAlcinous, most notable of all the people, verily it is a\\ngood thing to list to a minstrel such as this one, like to\\nthe gods in voice. Nay, as for me, I say that there is no\\nmore gracious or perfect delight than when a whole people\\nmakes merry, and the men sit orderly at feast in the halls\\nand listen to the singer, and the tables by them are laden\\nwith bread and flesh, and a wine-bearer drawing the wine\\nserves it round and pours it into the cups. This seems to\\nme well-nigh the fairest thing in the world. But now thy\\nheart was inclined to ask of my grievous troubles, that I\\nmay mourn for more exceeding sorrow. What then shall I tell\\nof first, what last, for the gods of heaven have given me\\nwoes in plenty? Now, first, will I tell my name, that ye\\ntoo may know it, and that I, when I have escaped the\\npitiless day, may yet be your host, though my home is in a\\nfar country. I am ODYSSEUS, SON OF LAERTES, who am in men\\'s\\nminds for all manner of wiles, and my fame reaches unto\\nheaven. And I dwell in clear-seen Ithaca, wherein is a\\nmountain Neriton, with trembling forest leaves, standing\\nmanifest to view, and many islands lie around, very near\\none to the other, Dulichium and Same, and wooded Zacynthus.\\nNow Ithaca lies low, furthest up the sea-line toward the\\ndarkness, but those others face the dawning and the sun: a\\nrugged isle, but a good nurse of noble youths; and for\\nmyself I can see nought beside sweeter than a man\\'s own\\ncountry. Verily Calypso, the fair goddess, would fain have\\nkept me with her in her hollow caves, longing to have me\\nfor her lord; and likewise too, guileful Circe of Aia,\\nwould have stayed me in her halls, longing to have me for\\nher lord. But never did they prevail upon my heart within\\nmy breast. So surely is there nought sweeter than a man\\'s\\nown country and his parents, even though he dwell far off\\nin a rich home, in a strange land, away from them that\\nbegat him. But come, let me tell thee too of the troubles\\nof my journeying, which Zeus laid on me as I came from\\nTroy.\\n\\n\\'The wind that bare me from Ilios brought me nigh to the\\nCicones, even to Ismarus, whereupon I sacked their city and\\nslew the people. And from out the city we took their wives\\nand much substance, and divided them amongst us, that none\\nthrough me might go lacking his proper share. Howbeit,\\nthereafter I commanded that we should flee with a swift\\nfoot, but my men in their great folly hearkened not. There\\nwas much wine still a drinking, and still they slew many\\nflocks of sheep by the seashore and kine with trailing feet\\nand shambling gait. Meanwhile the Cicones went and raised a\\ncry to other Cicones their neighbours, dwelling inland, who\\nwere more in number than they and braver withal: skilled\\nthey were to fight with men from chariots, and when need\\nwas on foot. So they gathered in the early morning as thick\\nas leaves and flowers that spring in their season--yea and\\nin that hour an evil doom of Zeus stood by us, ill-fated\\nmen, that so we might be sore afflicted. They set their\\nbattle in array by the swift ships, and the hosts cast at\\none another with their bronze-shod spears. So long as it\\nwas morn and the sacred day waxed stronger, so long we\\nabode their assault and beat them off, albeit they\\noutnumbered us. But when the sun was wending to the time of\\nthe loosing of cattle, then at last the Cicones drave in\\nthe Achaeans and overcame them, and six of my\\ngoodly-greaved company perished from each ship: but the\\nremnant of us escaped death and destiny.\\n\\n\\'Thence we sailed onward stricken at heart, yet glad as men\\nsaved from death, albeit we had lost our dear companions.\\nNor did my curved ships move onward ere we had called\\nthrice on each of those our hapless fellows, who died at\\nthe hands of the Cicones on the plain. Now Zeus, gatherer\\nof the clouds, aroused the North Wind against our ships\\nwith a terrible tempest, and covered land and sea alike\\nwith clouds, and down sped night from heaven. Thus the\\nships were driven headlong, and their sails were torn to\\nshreds by the might of the wind. So we lowered the sails\\ninto the hold, in fear of death, but rowed the ships\\nlandward apace. There for two nights and two days we lay\\ncontinually, consuming our hearts with weariness and\\nsorrow. But when the fair-tressed Dawn had at last brought\\nthe full light of the third day, we set up the masts and\\nhoisted the white sails and sat us down, while the wind and\\nthe helmsman guided the ships. And now I should have come\\nto mine own country all unhurt, but the wave and the stream\\nof the sea and the North Wind swept me from my course as I\\nwas doubling Malea, and drave me wandering past Cythera.\\n\\n\\'Thence for nine whole days was I borne by ruinous winds\\nover the teeming deep; but on the tenth day we set foot on\\nthe land of the lotus-eaters, who eat a flowery food. So we\\nstepped ashore and drew water, and straightway my company\\ntook their midday meal by the swift ships. Now when we had\\ntasted meat and drink I sent forth certain of my company to\\ngo and make search what manner of men they were who here\\nlive upon the earth by bread, and I chose out two of my\\nfellows, and sent a third with them as herald. Then\\nstraightway they went and mixed with the men of the\\nlotus-eaters, and so it was that the lotus-eaters devised\\nnot death for our fellows, but gave them of the lotus to\\ntaste. Now whosoever of them did eat the honey-sweet fruit\\nof the lotus, had no more wish to bring tidings nor to come\\nback, but there he chose to abide with the lotus-eating\\nmen, ever feeding on the lotus, and forgetful of his\\nhomeward way. Therefore I led them back to the ships\\nweeping, and sore against their will, and dragged them\\nbeneath the benches, and bound them in the hollow barques.\\nBut I commanded the rest of my well-loved company to make\\nspeed and go on board the swift ships, lest haply any\\nshould eat of the lotus and be forgetful of returning.\\nRight soon they embarked, and sat upon the benches, and\\nsitting orderly they smote the grey sea water with their\\noars.\\n\\n\\'Thence we sailed onward stricken at heart. And we came to\\nthe land of the Cyclopes, a froward and a lawless folk, who\\ntrusting to the deathless gods plant not aught with their\\nhands, neither plough: but, behold, all these things spring\\nfor them in plenty, unsown and untilled, wheat, and barley,\\nand vines, which bear great clusters of the juice of the\\ngrape, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase. These have\\nneither gatherings for council nor oracles of law, but they\\ndwell in hollow caves on the crests of the high hills, and\\neach one utters the law to his children and his wives, and\\nthey reck not one of another.\\n\\n\\'Now there is a waste isle stretching without the harbour\\nof the land of the Cyclopes, neither nigh at hand nor yet\\nafar off, a woodland isle, wherein are wild goats\\nunnumbered, for no path of men scares them, nor do hunters\\nresort thither who suffer hardships in the wood, as they\\nrange the mountain crests. Moreover it is possessed neither\\nby flocks nor by ploughed lands, but the soil lies unsown\\nevermore and untilled, desolate of men, and feeds the\\nbleating goats. For the Cyclopes have by them no ships with\\nvermilion cheek, not yet are there shipwrights in the\\nisland, who might fashion decked barques, which should\\naccomplish all their desire, voyaging to the towns of men\\n(as ofttimes men cross the sea to one another in ships),\\nwho might likewise have made of their isle a goodly\\nsettlement. Yea, it is in no wise a sorry land, but would\\nbear all things in their season; for therein are soft water\\nmeadows by the shores of the grey salt sea, and there the\\nvines know no decay, and the land is level to plough;\\nthence might they reap a crop exceeding deep in due season,\\nfor verily there is fatness beneath the soil. Also there is\\na fair haven, where is no need of moorings, either to cast\\nanchor or to fasten hawsers, but men may run the ship on\\nthe beach, and tarry until such time as the sailors are\\nminded to be gone, and favourable breezes blow. Now at the\\nhead of the harbour is a well of bright water issuing from\\na cave, and round it are poplars growing. Thither we\\nsailed, and some god guided us through the night, for it\\nwas dark and there was no light to see, a mist lying deep\\nabout the ships, nor did the moon show her light from\\nheaven, but was shut in with clouds. No man then beheld\\nthat island, neither saw we the long waves rolling to the\\nbeach, till we had run our decked ships ashore. And when\\nour ships were beached, we took down all their sails, and\\nourselves too stept forth upon the strand of the sea, and\\nthere we fell into sound sleep and waited for the bright\\nDawn.\\n\\n\\'So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, in\\nwonder at the island we roamed over the length thereof: and\\nthe Nymphs, the daughters of Zeus, lord of the aegis,\\nstarted the wild goats of the hills, that my company might\\nhave wherewith to sup. Anon we took to us our curved bows\\nfrom out the ships and long spears, and arrayed in three\\nbands we began shooting at the goats; and the god soon gave\\nus game in plenty. Now twelve ships bare me company, and to\\neach ship fell nine goats for a portion, but for me alone\\nthey set ten apart.\\n\\n\\'Thus we sat there the livelong day until the going down of\\nthe sun, feasting on abundant flesh and on sweet wine. For\\nthe red wine was not yet spent from out the ships, but\\nsomewhat was yet therein, for we had each one drawn off\\nlarge store thereof in jars, when we took the sacred\\ncitadel of the Cicones. And we looked across to the land of\\nthe Cyclopes, who dwell nigh, and to the smoke, and to the\\nvoice of the men, and of the sheep and of the goats. And\\nwhen the sun had sunk and darkness had come on, then we\\nlaid us to rest upon the sea-beach. So soon as early Dawn\\nshone forth, the rosy-fingered, then I called a gathering\\nof my men, and spake among them all:\\n\\n\\'\"Abide here all the rest of you, my dear companions; but I\\nwill go with mine own ship and my ship\\'s company, and make\\nproof of these men, what manner of folk they are, whether\\nfroward, and wild, and unjust, or hospitable and of\\ngod-fearing mind.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and I climbed the ship\\'s side, and bade my\\ncompany themselves to mount, and to loose the hawsers. So\\nthey soon embarked and sat upon the benches, and sitting\\norderly smote the grey sea water with their oars. Now when\\nwe had come to the land that lies hard by, we saw a cave on\\nthe border near to the sea, lofty and roofed over with\\nlaurels, and there many flocks of sheep and goats were used\\nto rest. And about it a high outer court was built with\\nstones, deep bedded, and with tall pines and oaks with\\ntheir high crown of leaves. And a man was wont to sleep\\ntherein, of monstrous size, who shepherded his flocks alone\\nand afar, and was not conversant with others, but dwelt\\napart in lawlessness of mind. Yea, for he was a monstrous\\nthing and fashioned marvellously, nor was he like to any\\nman that lives by bread, but like a wooded peak of the\\ntowering hills, which stands out apart and alone from\\nothers.\\n\\n\\'Then I commanded the rest of my well-loved company to\\ntarry there by the ship, and to guard the ship, but I chose\\nout twelve men, the best of my company, and sallied forth.\\nNow I had with me a goat-skin of the dark wine and sweet\\nwhich Maron, son of Euanthes, had given me, the priest of\\nApollo, the god that watched over Ismarus. And he gave it,\\nfor that we had protected him with his wife and child\\nreverently; for he dwelt in a thick grove of Phoebus\\nApollo. And he made me splendid gifts; he gave me seven\\ntalents of gold well wrought, and he gave me a mixing bowl\\nof pure silver, and furthermore wine which he drew off in\\ntwelve jars in all, sweet wine unmingled, a draught divine;\\nnor did any of his servants or of his handmaids in the\\nhouse know thereof, but himself and his dear wife and one\\nhousedame only. And as often as they drank that red wine\\nhoney sweet, he would fill one cup and pour it into twenty\\nmeasures of water, and a marvellous sweet smell went up\\nfrom the mixing bowl: then truly it was no pleasure to\\nrefrain.\\n\\n\\'With this wine I filled a great skin, and bare it with me,\\nand corn too I put in a wallet, for my lordly spirit\\nstraightway had a boding that a man would come to me, a\\nstrange man, clothed in mighty strength, one that knew not\\njudgment and justice. {*}\\n\\n{* Literally, knowing neither dooms, nor ordinances of\\nlaw.}\\n\\n\\'Soon we came to the cave, but we found him not within; he\\nwas shepherding his fat flocks in the pastures. So we went\\ninto the cave, and gazed on all that was therein. The\\nbaskets were well laden with cheeses, and the folds were\\nthronged with lambs and kids; each kind was penned by\\nitself, the firstlings apart, and the summer lambs apart,\\napart too the younglings of the flock. Now all the vessels\\nswam with whey, the milk-pails and the bowls, the\\nwell-wrought vessels whereinto he milked. My company then\\nspake and besought me first of all to take of the cheeses\\nand to return, and afterwards to make haste and drive off\\nthe kids and lambs to the swift ships from out the pens,\\nand to sail over the salt sea water. Howbeit I hearkened\\nnot (and far better would it have been), but waited to see\\nthe giant himself, and whether he would give me gifts as a\\nstranger\\'s due. Yet was not his coming to be with joy to my\\ncompany.\\n\\n\\'Then we kindled a fire, and made burnt-offering, and\\nourselves likewise took of the cheeses, and did eat, and\\nsat waiting for him within till he came back, shepherding\\nhis flocks. And he bore a grievous weight of dry wood,\\nagainst supper time. This log he cast down with a din\\ninside the cave, and in fear we fled to the secret place of\\nthe rock. As for him, he drave his fat flocks into the wide\\ncavern, even all that he was wont to milk; but the males\\nboth of the sheep and of the goats he left without in the\\ndeep yard. Thereafter he lifted a huge doorstone and\\nweighty, and set it in the mouth of the cave, such an one\\nas two and twenty good four-wheeled wains could not raise\\nfrom the ground, so mighty a sheer rock did he set against\\nthe doorway. Then he sat down and milked the ewes and\\nbleating goats, all orderly, and beneath each ewe he placed\\nher young. And anon he curdled one half of the white milk,\\nand massed it together, and stored it in wicker-baskets,\\nand the other half he let stand in pails, that he might\\nhave it to take and drink against supper time. Now when he\\nhad done all his work busily, then he kindled the fire\\nanew, and espied us, and made question:\\n\\n\\'\"Strangers, who are ye? Whence sail ye over the wet ways?\\nOn some trading enterprise or at adventure do ye rove, even\\nas sea-robbers over the brine, for at hazard of their own\\nlives they wander, bringing bale to alien men.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake he, but as for us our heart within us was broken\\nfor terror of the deep voice and his own monstrous shape;\\nyet despite all I answered and spake unto him, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Lo, we are Achaeans, driven wandering from Troy, by all\\nmanner of winds over the great gulf of the sea; seeking our\\nhomes we fare, but another path have we come, by other\\nways: even such, methinks, was the will and the counsel of\\nZeus. And we avow us to be the men of Agamemnon, son of\\nAtreus, whose fame is even now the mightiest under heaven,\\nso great a city did he sack, and destroyed many people; but\\nas for us we have lighted here, and come to these thy\\nknees, if perchance thou wilt give us a stranger\\'s gift, or\\nmake any present, as is the due of strangers. Nay, lord,\\nhave regard to the gods, for we are thy suppliants; and\\nZeus is the avenger of suppliants and sojourners, Zeus, the\\ngod of the stranger, who fareth in the company of reverend\\nstrangers.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and anon he answered out of his pitiless\\nheart: \"Thou art witless, my stranger, or thou hast come\\nfrom afar, who biddest me either to fear or shun the gods.\\nFor the Cyclopes pay no heed to Zeus, lord of the aegis,\\nnor to the blessed gods, for verily we are better men than\\nthey. Nor would I, to shun the enmity of Zeus, spare either\\nthee or thy company, unless my spirit bade me. But tell me\\nwhere thou didst stay thy well-wrought ship on thy coming?\\nWas it perchance at the far end of the island, or hard by,\\nthat I may know?\"\\n\\n\\'So he spake tempting me, but he cheated me not, who knew\\nfull much, and I answered him again with words of guile:\\n\\n\\'\"As for my ship, Poseidon, the shaker of the earth, brake\\nit to pieces, for he cast it upon the rocks at the border\\nof your country, and brought it nigh the headland, and a\\nwind bare it thither from the sea. But I with these my men\\nescaped from utter doom.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and out of his pitiless heart he answered me\\nnot a word, but sprang up, and laid his hands upon my\\nfellows, and clutching two together dashed them, as they\\nhad been whelps, to the earth, and the brain flowed forth\\nupon the ground, and the earth was wet. Then cut he them up\\npiecemeal, and made ready his supper. So he ate even as a\\nmountain-bred lion, and ceased not, devouring entrails and\\nflesh and bones with their marrow. And we wept and raised\\nour hands to Zeus, beholding the cruel deeds; and we were\\nat our wits\\' end. And after the Cyclops had filled his huge\\nmaw with human flesh and the milk he drank thereafter, he\\nlay within the cave, stretched out among his sheep.\\n\\n\\'So I took counsel in my great heart, whether I should draw\\nnear, and pluck my sharp sword from my thigh, and stab him\\nin the breast, where the midriff holds the liver, feeling\\nfor the place with my hand. But my second thought withheld\\nme, for so should we too have perished even there with\\nutter doom. For we should not have prevailed to roll away\\nwith our hands from the lofty door the heavy stone which he\\nset there. So for that time we made moan, awaiting the\\nbright Dawn.\\n\\n\\'Now when early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, again\\nhe kindled the fire and milked his goodly flocks all\\norderly, and beneath each ewe set her lamb. Anon when he\\nhad done all his work busily, again he seized yet other two\\nmen and made ready his mid-day meal. And after the meal,\\nlightly he moved away the great door-stone, and drave his\\nfat flocks forth from the cave, and afterwards he set it in\\nhis place again, as one might set the lid on a quiver. Then\\nwith a loud whoop, the Cyclops turned his fat flocks\\ntowards the hills; but I was left devising evil in the deep\\nof my heart, if in any wise I might avenge me, and Athene\\ngrant me renown.\\n\\n\\'And this was the counsel that showed best in my sight.\\nThere lay by a sheep-fold a great club of the Cyclops, a\\nclub of olive wood, yet green, which he had cut to carry\\nwith him when it should be seasoned. Now when we saw it we\\nlikened it in size to the mast of a black ship of twenty\\noars, a wide merchant vessel that traverses the great sea\\ngulf, so huge it was to view in bulk and length. I stood\\nthereby and cut off from it a portion as it were a fathom\\'s\\nlength, and set it by my fellows, and bade them fine it\\ndown, and they made it even, while I stood by and sharpened\\nit to a point, and straightway I took it and hardened it in\\nthe bright fire. Then I laid it well away, and hid it\\nbeneath the dung, which was scattered in great heaps in the\\ndepths of the cave. And I bade my company cast lots among\\nthem, which of them should risk the adventure with me, and\\nlift the bar and turn it about in his eye, when sweet sleep\\ncame upon him. And the lot fell upon those four whom I\\nmyself would have been fain to choose, and I appointed\\nmyself to be the fifth among them. In the evening he came\\nshepherding his flocks of goodly fleece, and presently he\\ndrave his fat flocks into the cave each and all, nor left\\nhe any without in the deep court-yard, whether through some\\nforeboding, or perchance that the god so bade him do.\\nThereafter he lifted the huge door-stone and set it in the\\nmouth of the cave, and sitting down he milked the ewes and\\nbleating goats, all orderly, and beneath each ewe he placed\\nher young. Now when he had done all his work busily, again\\nhe seized yet other two and made ready his supper. Then I\\nstood by the Cyclops and spake to him, holding in my hands\\nan ivy bowl of the dark wine:\\n\\n\\'\"Cyclops, take and drink wine after thy feast of man\\'s\\nmeat, that thou mayest know what manner of drink this was\\nthat our ship held. And lo, I was bringing it thee as a\\ndrink offering, if haply thou mayest take pity and send me\\non my way home, but thy mad rage is past all sufferance. O\\nhard of heart, how may another of the many men there be\\ncome ever to thee again, seeing that thy deeds have been\\nlawless?\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and he took the cup and drank it off, and\\nfound great delight in drinking the sweet draught, and\\nasked me for it yet a second time:\\n\\n\\'\"Give it me again of thy grace, and tell me thy name\\nstraightway, that I may give thee a stranger\\'s gift,\\nwherein thou mayest be glad. Yea for the earth, the\\ngrain-giver, bears for the Cyclopes the mighty clusters of\\nthe juice of the grape, and the rain of Zeus gives them\\nincrease, but this is a rill of very nectar and ambrosia.\"\\n\\n\\'So he spake, and again I handed him the dark wine. Thrice\\nI bare and gave it him, and thrice in his folly he drank it\\nto the lees. Now when the wine had got about the wits of\\nthe Cyclops, then did I speak to him with soft words:\\n\\n\\'\"Cyclops, thou askest me my renowned name, and I will\\ndeclare it unto thee, and do thou grant me a stranger\\'s\\ngift, as thou didst promise. Noman is my name, and Noman\\nthey call me, my father and my mother and all my fellows.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and straightway he answered me out of his\\npitiless heart:\\n\\n\\'\"Noman will I eat last in the number of his fellows, and\\nthe others before him: that shall be thy gift.\"\\n\\n\\'Therewith he sank backwards and fell with face upturned,\\nand there he lay with his great neck bent round, and sleep,\\nthat conquers all men, overcame him. And the wine and the\\nfragments of men\\'s flesh issued forth from his mouth, and\\nhe vomited, being heavy with wine. Then I thrust in that\\nstake under the deep ashes, until it should grow hot, and I\\nspake to my companions comfortable words, lest any should\\nhang back from me in fear. But when that bar of olive wood\\nwas just about to catch fire in the flame, green though it\\nwas, and began to glow terribly, even then I came nigh, and\\ndrew it from the coals, and my fellows gathered about me,\\nand some god breathed great courage into us. For their part\\nthey seized the bar of olive wood, that was sharpened at\\nthe point, and thrust it into his eye, while I from my\\nplace aloft turned it about, as when a man bores a ship\\'s\\nbeam with a drill while his fellows below spin it with a\\nstrap, which they hold at either end, and the auger runs\\nround continually. Even so did we seize the fiery-pointed\\nbrand and whirled it round in his eye, and the blood flowed\\nabout the heated bar. And the breath of the flame singed\\nhis eyelids and brows all about, as the ball of the eye\\nburnt away, and the roots thereof crackled in the flame.\\nAnd as when a smith dips an axe or adze in chill water with\\na great hissing, when he would temper it--for hereby anon\\ncomes the strength of iron--even so did his eye hiss round\\nthe stake of olive. And he raised a great and terrible cry,\\nthat the rock rang around, and we fled away in fear, while\\nhe plucked forth from his eye the brand bedabbled in much\\nblood. Then maddened with pain he cast it from him with his\\nhands, and called with a loud voice on the Cyclopes, who\\ndwelt about him in the caves along the windy heights. And\\nthey heard the cry and flocked together from every side,\\nand gathering round the cave asked him what ailed him:\\n\\n\\'\"What hath so distressed thee, Polyphemus, that thou\\ncriest thus aloud through the immortal night, and makest us\\nsleepless? Surely no mortal driveth off thy flocks against\\nthy will: surely none slayeth thyself by force or craft?\"\\n\\n\\'And the strong Polyphemus spake to them again from out the\\ncave: \"My friends, Noman is slaying me by guile, nor at all\\nby force.\"\\n\\n\\'And they answered and spake winged words: \"If then no man\\nis violently handling thee in thy solitude, it can in no\\nwise be that thou shouldest escape the sickness sent by\\nmighty Zeus. Nay, pray thou to thy father, the lord\\nPoseidon.\"\\n\\n\\'On this wise they spake and departed; and my heart within\\nme laughed to see how my name and cunning counsel had\\nbeguiled them. But the Cyclops, groaning and travailing in\\npain, groped with his hands, and lifted away the stone from\\nthe door of the cave, and himself sat in the entry, with\\narms outstretched to catch, if he might, any one that was\\ngoing forth with his sheep, so witless, methinks, did he\\nhope to find me. But I advised me how all might be for the\\nvery best, if perchance I might find a way of escape from\\ndeath for my companions and myself, and I wove all manner\\nof craft and counsel, as a man will for his life, seeing\\nthat great mischief was nigh. And this was the counsel that\\nshowed best in my sight. The rams of the flock were well\\nnurtured and thick of fleece, great and goodly, with wool\\ndark as the violet. Quietly I lashed them together with\\ntwisted withies, whereon the Cyclops slept, that lawless\\nmonster. Three together I took: now the middle one of the\\nthree would bear each a man, but the other twain went on\\neither side, saving my fellows. Thus every three sheep bare\\ntheir man. But as for me I laid hold of the back of a young\\nram who was far the best and the goodliest of all the\\nflock, and curled beneath his shaggy belly there I lay, and\\nso clung face upward, grasping the wondrous fleece with a\\nsteadfast heart. So for that time making moan we awaited\\nthe bright Dawn.\\n\\n\\'So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, then\\ndid the rams of the flock hasten forth to pasture, but the\\newes bleated unmilked about the pens, for their udders were\\nswollen to bursting. Then their lord, sore stricken with\\npain, felt along the backs of all the sheep as they stood\\nup before him, and guessed not in his folly how that my men\\nwere bound beneath the breasts of his thick-fleeced flocks.\\nLast of all the sheep came forth the ram, cumbered with his\\nwool, and the weight of me and my cunning. And the strong\\nPolyphemus laid his hands on him and spake to him saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Dear ram, wherefore, I pray thee, art thou the last of\\nall the flocks to go forth from the cave, who of old wast\\nnot wont to lag behind the sheep, but wert ever the\\nforemost to pluck the tender blossom of the pasture, faring\\nwith long strides, and wert still the first to come to the\\nstreams of the rivers, and first did long to return to the\\nhomestead in the evening? But now art thou the very last.\\nSurely thou art sorrowing for the eye of thy lord, which an\\nevil man blinded, with his accursed fellows, when he had\\nsubdued my wits with wine, even Noman, whom I say hath not\\nyet escaped destruction. Ah, if thou couldst feel as I, and\\nbe endued with speech, to tell me where he shifts about to\\nshun my wrath; then should he be smitten, and his brains be\\ndashed against the floor here and there about the cave, and\\nmy heart be lightened of the sorrows which Noman, nothing\\nworth, hath brought me!\"\\n\\n\\'Therewith he sent the ram forth from him, and when we had\\ngone but a little way from the cave and from the yard,\\nfirst I loosed myself from under the ram and then I set my\\nfellows free. And swiftly we drave on those stiff-shanked\\nsheep, so rich in fat, and often turned to look about, till\\nwe came to the ship. And a glad sight to our fellows were\\nwe that had fled from death, but the others they would have\\nbemoaned with tears; howbeit I suffered it not, but with\\nfrowning brows forbade each man to weep. Rather I bade them\\nto cast on board the many sheep with goodly fleece, and to\\nsail over the salt sea water. So they embarked forthwith,\\nand sate upon the benches, and sitting orderly smote the\\ngrey sea water with their oars. But when I had not gone so\\nfar, but that a man\\'s shout might be heard, then I spoke\\nunto the Cyclops taunting him:\\n\\n\\'\"Cyclops, so thou wert not to eat the company of a\\nweakling by main might in thy hollow cave! Thine evil deeds\\nwere very sure to find thee out, thou cruel man, who hadst\\nno shame to eat thy guests within thy gates, wherefore Zeus\\nhath requited thee, and the other gods.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and he was mightily angered at heart, and he\\nbrake off the peak of a great hill and threw it at us, and\\nit fell in front of the dark-prowed ship. {*} And the sea\\nheaved beneath the fall of the rock, and the backward flow\\nof the wave bare the ship quickly to the dry land, with the\\nwash from the deep sea, and drave it to the shore. Then I\\ncaught up a long pole in my hands, and thrust the ship from\\noff the land, and roused my company, and with a motion of\\nthe head bade them dash in with their oars, that so we\\nmight escape our evil plight. So they bent to their oars\\nand rowed on. But when we had now made twice the distance\\nover the brine, I would fain have spoken to the Cyclops,\\nbut my company stayed me on every side with soft words,\\nsaying:\\n\\n{* We have omitted line 483, as required by the sense. It\\nis introduced here from line 540.}\\n\\n\\'\"Foolhardy that thou art, why wouldst thou rouse a wild\\nman to wrath, who even now hath cast so mighty a throw\\ntowards the deep and brought our ship back to land, yea and\\nwe thought that we had perished {*} even there? If he had\\nheard any of us utter sound or speech he would have crushed\\nour heads and our ship timbers with a cast of a rugged\\nstone, so mightily he hurls.\"\\n\\n{* Neither in this passage nor in B ii.171 nor in B xx.121\\ndo we think that the aorist infinitive after a verb of\\nsaying can bear a future sense. The aorist infinitive after\\n[Greek] (ii.280, vii.76) is hardly an argument in its\\nfavour; the infinitive there is in fact a noun in the\\ngenitive case.}\\n\\n\\'So spake they, but they prevailed not on my lordly spirit,\\nand I answered him again from out an angry heart:\\n\\n\\'\"Cyclops, if any one of mortal men shall ask thee of the\\nunsightly blinding of thine eye, say that it was Odysseus\\nthat blinded it, the waster of cities, son of Laertes,\\nwhose dwelling is in Ithaca.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and with a moan he answered me, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Lo now, in very truth the ancient oracles have come upon\\nme. There lived here a soothsayer, a noble man and a\\nmighty, Telemus, son of Eurymus, who surpassed all men in\\nsoothsaying, and waxed old as a seer among the Cyclopes. He\\ntold me that all these things should come to pass in the\\naftertime, even that I should lose my eyesight at the hand\\nof Odysseus. But I ever looked for some tall and goodly man\\nto come hither, clad in great might, but behold now one\\nthat is a dwarf, a man of no worth and a weakling, hath\\nblinded me of my eye after subduing me with wine. Nay come\\nhither, Odysseus, that I may set by thee a stranger\\'s\\ncheer, and speed thy parting hence, that so the\\nEarth-shaker may vouchsafe it thee, for his son am I, and\\nhe avows him for my father. And he himself will heal me, if\\nit be his will; and none other of the blessed gods or of\\nmortal men.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so he spake, but I answered him, and said: \"Would god\\nthat I were as sure to rob thee of soul and life, and send\\nthee within the house of Hades, as I am that not even the\\nEarth-shaker will heal thine eye!\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and then he prayed to the lord Poseidon\\nstretching forth his hands to the starry heaven: \"Hear me,\\nPoseidon, girdler of the earth, god of the dark hair, if\\nindeed I be thine, and thou avowest thee my sire,--grant\\nthat he may never come to his home, even Odysseus, waster\\nof cities, the son of Laertes, whose dwelling is in Ithaca;\\nyet if he is ordained to see his friends and come unto his\\nwell-builded house, and his own country, late may he come\\nin evil case, with the loss of all his company, in the ship\\nof strangers, and find sorrows in his house.\"\\n\\n\\'So he spake in prayer, and the god of the dark locks heard\\nhim. And once again he lifted a stone, far greater than the\\nfirst, and with one swing he hurled it, and he put forth a\\nmeasureless strength, and cast it but a little space behind\\nthe dark-prowed ship, and all but struck the end of the\\nrudder. And the sea heaved beneath the fall of the rock,\\nbut the wave bare on the ship and drave it to the further\\nshore.\\n\\n\\'But when he had now reached that island, where all our\\nother decked ships abode together, and our company were\\ngathered sorrowing, expecting us evermore, on our coming\\nthither we ran our ship ashore upon the sand, and ourselves\\ntoo stept forth upon the sea beach. Next we took forth the\\nsheep of the Cyclops from out the hollow ship, and divided\\nthem, that none through me might go lacking his proper\\nshare. But the ram for me alone my goodly-greaved company\\nchose out, in the dividing of the sheep, and on the shore I\\noffered him up to Zeus, even to the son of Cronos, who\\ndwells in the dark clouds, and is lord of all, and I burnt\\nthe slices of the thighs. But he heeded not the sacrifice,\\nbut was devising how my decked ships and my dear company\\nmight perish utterly. Thus for that time we sat the\\nlivelong day, until the going down of the sun, feasting on\\nabundant flesh and sweet wine. And when the sun had sunk\\nand darkness had come on, then we laid us to rest upon the\\nsea beach. So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the\\nrosy-fingered, I called to my company, and commanded them\\nthat they should themselves climb the ship and loose the\\nhawsers. So they soon embarked and sat upon the benches,\\nand sitting orderly smote the grey sea water with their\\noars.\\n\\n\\'Thence we sailed onward stricken at heart, yet glad as men\\nsaved from death, albeit we had lost our dear companions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook X\\n\\n  Odysseus, his entertainment by Aeolus, of whom he received\\n  a fair wind for the present, and all the rest of the winds\\n  tied up in a bag; which his men untying, flew out, and\\n  carried him back to Aeolus, who refused to receive him. His\\n  adventure at Laestrygonia with Antiphates, where of twelve\\n  ships he lost eleven, men and all. How he went thence to\\n  the Isle of Aea, where half of his men were turned by Circe\\n  into swine, and how he went himself, and by the help of\\n  Hermes recovered them and stayed with Circe a year.\\n\\n\\'Then we came to the isle Aeolian, where dwelt Aeolus, son\\nof Hippotas, dear too the deathless gods, in a floating\\nisland, and all about it is a wall of bronze unbroken, and\\nthe cliff runs up sheer from the sea. His twelve children\\nto abide there in his halls, six daughters and six lusty\\nsons; and, behold, he gave his daughters to his sons to\\nwife. And they feast evermore by their dear father and\\ntheir kind mother, and dainties innumerable lie ready to\\ntheir hands. And the house is full of the savour of\\nfeasting, and the noise thereof rings round, yea in the\\ncourtyard, by day, and in the night they sleep each one by\\nhis chaste wife in coverlets and on jointed bedsteads. So\\nthen we came to their city and their goodly dwelling, and\\nthe king entreated me kindly for a whole month, and sought\\nout each thing, Ilios and the ships of the Argives, and the\\nreturn of the Achaeans. So I told him all the tale in order\\nduly. But when I in turn took the word and asked of my\\njourney, and bade him send me on my way, he too denied me\\nnot, but furnished an escort. He gave me a wallet, made of\\nthe hide of an ox of nine seasons old, which he let flay,\\nand therein he bound the ways of all the noisy winds; for\\nhim the son of Cronos made keeper of the winds, either to\\nlull or to rouse what blasts he will. And he made it fast\\nin the hold of the ship with a shining silver thong, that\\nnot the faintest breath might escape. Then he sent forth\\nthe blast of the West Wind to blow for me, to bear our\\nships and ourselves upon our way; but this he was never to\\nbring to pass, for we were undone through our own\\nheedlessness.\\n\\n\\'For nine whole days we sailed by night and day\\ncontinually, and now on the tenth day my native land came\\nin sight, and already we were so near that we beheld the\\nfolk tending the beacon fires. Then over me there came\\nsweet slumber in my weariness, for all the time I was\\nholding the sheet, nor gave it to any of my company, that\\nso we might come quicker to our own country. Meanwhile my\\ncompany held converse together, and said that I was\\nbringing home for myself gold and silver, gifts from Aeolus\\nthe high-hearted son of Hippotas. And thus would they speak\\nlooking each man to his neighbour:\\n\\n\\'\"Lo now, how beloved he is and highly esteemed among all\\nmen, to the city and land of whomsoever he may come. Many\\nare the goodly treasures he taketh with him out of the\\nspoil from Troy, while we who have fulfilled like\\njourneying with him return homeward bringing with us but\\nempty hands. And now Aeolus hath given unto him these\\nthings freely in his love. Nay come, let us quickly see\\nwhat they are, even what wealth of gold and silver is in\\nthe wallet.\"\\n\\n\\'So they spake, and the evil counsel of my company\\nprevailed. They loosed the wallet, and all the winds brake\\nforth. And the violent blast seized my men, and bare them\\ntowards the high seas weeping, away from their own country;\\nbut as for me, I awoke and communed with my great heart,\\nwhether I should cast myself from the ship and perish in\\nthe deep, or endure in silence and abide yet among the\\nliving. Howbeit I hardened my heart to endure, and muffling\\nmy head I lay still in the ship. But the vessels were\\ndriven by the evil storm-wind back to the isle Aeolian, and\\nmy company made moan.\\n\\n\\'There we stepped ashore and drew water, and my company\\npresently took their midday meal by the swift ships. Now\\nwhen we had tasted bread and wine, I took with me a herald\\nand one of my company, and went to the famous dwelling of\\nAeolus: and I found him feasting with his wife and\\nchildren. So we went in and sat by the pillars of the door\\non the threshold, and they all marvelled and asked us:\\n\\n\\'\"How hast thou come hither, Odysseus? What evil god\\nassailed thee? Surely we sent thee on thy way with all\\ndiligence, that thou mightest get thee to thine own country\\nand thy home, and whithersoever thou wouldest.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so they said, but I spake among them heavy at heart:\\n\"My evil company hath been my bane, and sleep thereto\\nremorseless. Come, my friends, do ye heal the harm, for\\nyours is the power.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, beseeching them in soft words, but they held\\ntheir peace. And the father answered, saying: \"Get thee\\nforth from the island straightway, thou that art the most\\nreprobate of living men. Far be it from me to help or to\\nfurther that man whom the blessed gods abhor! Get thee\\nforth, for lo, thy coming marks thee hated by the deathless\\ngods.\"\\n\\n\\'Therewith he sent me forth from the house making heavy\\nmoan. Thence we sailed onwards stricken at heart. And the\\nspirit of the men was spent beneath the grievous rowing by\\nreason of our vain endeavour, for there was no more any\\nsign of a wafting wind. So for the space of six days we\\nsailed by night and day continually, and on the seventh we\\ncame to the steep stronghold of Lamos, Telepylos of the\\nLaestrygons, where herdsman hails herdsman as he drives in\\nhis flock, and the other who drives forth answers the call.\\nThere might a sleepless man have earned a double wage, the\\none as neat-herd, the other shepherding white flocks: so\\nnear are the outgoings of the night and of the day.\\nThither when he had come to the fair haven, whereabout on\\nboth sides goes one steep cliff unbroken and jutting\\nheadlands over against each other stretch forth at the\\nmouth of the harbour, and strait is the entrance; thereinto\\nall the others steered their curved ships. Now the vessels\\nwere bound within the hollow harbour each hard by other,\\nfor no wave ever swelled within it, great or small, but\\nthere was a bright calm all around. But I alone moored my\\ndark ship without the harbour, at the uttermost point\\nthereof, and made fast the hawser to a rock. And I went up\\na craggy hill, a place of out-look, and stood thereon:\\nthence there was no sign of the labour of men or oxen, only\\nwe saw the smoke curling upward from the land. Then I sent\\nforth certain of my company to go and search out what\\nmanner of men they were who here live upon the earth by\\nbread, choosing out two of my company and sending a third\\nwith them as herald. Now when they had gone ashore, they\\nwent along a level road whereby wains were wont to draw\\ndown wood from the high hills to the town. And without the\\ntown they fell in with a damsel drawing water, the noble\\ndaughter of Laestrygonian Antiphates. She had come down to\\nthe clear-flowing spring Artacia, for thence it was custom\\nto draw water to the town. So they stood by her and spake\\nunto her, and asked who was king of that land, and who they\\nwere he ruled over. Then at once she showed them the\\nhigh-roofed hall of her father. Now when they had entered\\nthe renowned house, they found his wife therein: she was\\nhuge of bulk as a mountain peak and was loathly in their\\nsight. Straightway she called the renowned Antiphates, her\\nlord, from the assembly-place, and he contrived a pitiful\\ndestruction for my men. Forthwith he clutched up one of my\\ncompany and made ready his midday meal, but the other twain\\nsprang up and came in flight to the ships. Then he raised\\nthe war cry through the town, and the valiant Laestrygons\\nat the sound thereof, flocked together from every side, a\\nhost past number, not like men but like the Giants. They\\ncast at us from the cliffs with great rocks, each of them a\\nman\\'s burden, and anon there arose from the fleet an evil\\ndin of men dying and ships shattered withal. And like folk\\nspearing fishes they bare home their hideous meal. While as\\nyet they were slaying my friends within the deep harbour, I\\ndrew my sharp sword from my thigh, and with it cut the\\nhawsers of my dark-prowed ship. Quickly then I called to my\\ncompany, and bade them dash in with the oars, that we might\\nclean escape this evil plight. And all with one accord they\\ntossed the sea water with the oar-blade, in dread of death,\\nand to my delight my barque flew forth to the high seas\\naway from the beetling rocks, but those other ships were\\nlost there, one and all.\\n\\n\\'Thence we sailed onward stricken at heart, yet glad as men\\nsaved from death, albeit we had lost our dear companions.\\nAnd we came to the isle Aeaean, where dwelt Circe of the\\nbraided tresses, an awful goddess of mortal speech, own\\nsister to the wizard Aeetes. Both were begotten of Helios,\\nwho gives light to all men, and their mother was Perse,\\ndaughter of Oceanus. There on the shore we put in with our\\nship into the sheltering haven silently, and some god was\\nour guide. Then we stept ashore, and for two days and two\\nnights lay there, consuming our own hearts for weariness\\nand pain. But when now the fair-tressed Dawn had brought\\nthe full light of the third day, then did I seize my spear\\nand my sharp sword, and quickly departing from the ship I\\nwent up unto a place of wide prospect, if haply I might see\\nany sign of the labour of men and hear the sound of their\\nspeech. So I went up a craggy hill, a place of out-look,\\nand I saw the smoke rising from the broad-wayed earth in\\nthe halls of Circe, through the thick coppice and the\\nwoodland. Then I mused in my mind and heart whether I\\nshould go and make discovery, for that I had seen the smoke\\nand flame. And as I thought thereon this seemed to me the\\nbetter counsel, to go first to the swift ship and to the\\nsea-banks, and give my company their midday meal, and then\\nsend them to make search. But as I came and drew nigh to\\nthe curved ship, some god even then took pity on me in my\\nloneliness, and sent a tall antlered stag across my very\\npath. He was coming down from his pasture in the woodland\\nto the river to drink, for verily the might of the sun was\\nsore upon him. And as he came up from out of the stream, I\\nsmote him on the spine in the middle of the back, and the\\nbrazen shaft went clean through him, and with a moan he\\nfell in the dust, and his life passed from him. Then I set\\nmy foot on him and drew forth the brazen shaft from the\\nwound, and laid it hard by upon the ground and let it lie.\\nNext I broke withies and willow twigs, and wove me a rope a\\nfathom in length, well twisted from end to end, and bound\\ntogether the feet of the huge beast, and went to the black\\nship bearing him across my neck, and leaning on a spear,\\nfor it was in no wise possible to carry him on my shoulder\\nwith the one hand, for he was a mighty quarry. And I threw\\nhim down before the ship and roused my company with soft\\nwords, standing by each man in turn:\\n\\n\\'\"Friends, for all our sorrows we shall not yet a while go\\ndown to the house of Hades, ere the coming of the day of\\ndestiny; go to then, while as yet there is meat and drink\\nin the swift ship, let us take thought thereof, that we be\\nnot famished for hunger.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so I spake, and they speedily hearkened to my words.\\nThey unmuffled their heads, and there on the shore of the\\nunharvested sea gazed at the stag, for he was a mighty\\nquarry. But after they had delighted their eyes with the\\nsight of him, they washed their hands and got ready the\\nglorious feast. So for that time we sat the livelong day\\ntill the going down of the sun, feasting on abundant flesh\\nand sweet wine. But when the sun sank and darkness had come\\non, then we laid us to rest upon the sea beach. So soon as\\nearly Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, I called a\\ngathering of my men and spake in the ears of them all:\\n\\n\\'\"Hear my works, my fellows, despite your evil case. My\\nfriends, lo, now we know not where is the place of darkness\\nor of dawning, nor where the Sun, that gives light to men,\\ngoes beneath the earth, nor where he rises; therefore let\\nus advise us speedily if any counsel yet may be: as for me,\\nI deem there is none. For I went up a craggy hill, a place\\nof out-look, and saw the island crowned about with the\\ncircle of the endless sea, the isle itself lying low; and\\nin the midst thereof mine eyes beheld the smoke through the\\nthick coppice and the woodland.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so I spake, but their spirit within them was broken,\\nas they remembered the deeds of Antiphates the\\nLaestrygonian, and all the evil violence of the haughty\\nCyclops, the man-eater. So they wept aloud shedding big\\ntears. Howbeit no avail came of their weeping.\\n\\n\\'Then I numbered my goodly-greaved company in two bands,\\nand appointed a leader for each, and I myself took the\\ncommand of the one part, and godlike Eurylochus of the\\nother. And anon we shook the lots in a brazen-fitted\\nhelmet, and out leapt the lot of proud Eurylochus. So he\\nwent on his way, and with him two and twenty of my\\nfellowship all weeping; and we were left behind making\\nlament. In the forest glades they found the halls of Circe\\nbuilded, of polished stone, in a place with wide prospect.\\nAnd all around the palace mountain-bred wolves and lions\\nwere roaming, whom she herself had bewitched with evil\\ndrugs that she gave them. Yet the beasts did not set on my\\nmen, but lo, they ramped about them and fawned on them,\\nwagging their long tails. And as when dogs fawn about their\\nlord when he comes from the feast, for he always brings\\nthem the fragments that soothe their mood, even so the\\nstrong-clawed wolves and the lions fawned around them; but\\nthey were affrighted when they saw the strange and terrible\\ncreatures. So they stood at the outer gate of the\\nfair-tressed goddess, and within they heard Circe singing\\nin a sweet voice, as she fared to and fro before the great\\nweb imperishable, such as is the handiwork of goddesses,\\nfine of woof and full of grace and splendour. Then Polites,\\na leader of men, the dearest to me and the trustiest of all\\nmy company, first spake to them:\\n\\n\\'\"Friends, forasmuch as there is one within that fares to\\nand fro before a mighty web singing a sweet song, so that\\nall the floor of the hall makes echo, a goddess she is or a\\nwoman; come quickly and cry aloud to her.\"\\n\\n\\'He spake the word and they cried aloud and called to her.\\nAnd straightway she came forth and opened the shining doors\\nand bade them in, and all went with her in their\\nheedlessness. But Eurylochus tarried behind, for he guessed\\nthat there was some treason. So she led them in and set\\nthem upon chairs and high seats, and made them a mess of\\ncheese and barley-meal and yellow honey with Pramnian wine,\\nand mixed harmful drugs with the food to make them utterly\\nforget their own country. Now when she had given them the\\ncup and they had drunk it off, presently she smote them\\nwith a wand, and in the styes of the swine she penned them.\\nSo they had the head and voice, the bristles and the shape\\nof swine, but their mind abode even as of old. Thus were\\nthey penned there weeping, and Circe flung them acorns and\\nmast and fruit of the cornel tree to eat, whereon wallowing\\nswine do always batten.\\n\\n\\'Now Eurylochus came back to the swift black ship to bring\\ntidings of his fellows, and of their unseemly doom. Not a\\nword could he utter, for all his desire, so deeply smitten\\nwas he to the heart with grief, and his eyes were filled\\nwith tears and his soul was fain of lamentation. But when\\nwe all had pressed him with our questions in amazement,\\neven then he told the fate of the remnant of our company.\\n\\n\\'\"We went, as thou didst command, through the coppice,\\nnoble Odysseus: we found within the forest glades the fair\\nhalls, builded of polished stone, in a place with wide\\nprospect. And there was one that fared before a mighty web\\nand sang a clear song, a goddess she was or a woman, and\\nthey cried aloud and called to her. And straightway she\\ncame forth, and opened the shining doors and bade them in,\\nand they all went with her in their heedlessness. But I\\ntarried behind, for I guessed that there was some treason.\\nThen they vanished away one and all, nor did any of them\\nappear again, though I sat long time watching.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake he, whereon I cast about my shoulder my\\nsilver-studded sword, a great blade of bronze, and slung my\\nbow about me and bade him lead me again by the way that he\\ncame. But he caught me with both hands, and by my knees he\\nbesought me, and bewailing him spake to me winged words:\\n\\n\\'\"Lead me not thither against my will, oh fosterling of\\nZeus, but leave me here! For well I know thou shalt thyself\\nreturn no more, nor bring any one of all thy fellowship;\\nnay, let us flee the swifter with those that be here, for\\neven yet may we escape the evil day.\"\\n\\n\\'On this wise he spake, but I answered him, saying:\\n\"Eurylochus, abide for thy part here in this place, eating\\nand drinking by the black hollow ship: but I will go forth,\\nfor a strong constraint is laid on me.\"\\n\\n\\'With that I went up from the ship and the sea-shore. But\\nlo, when in my faring through the sacred glades I was now\\ndrawing near to the great hall of the enchantress Circe,\\nthen did Hermes, of the golden wand, meet me as I\\napproached the house, in the likeness of a young man with\\nthe first down on his lip, the time when youth is most\\ngracious. So he clasped my hand and spake and hailed me:\\n\\n\\'\"Ah, hapless man, whither away again, all alone through\\nthe wolds, thou that knowest not this country? And thy\\ncompany yonder in the hall of Circe are penned in the guise\\nof swine, in their deep lairs abiding. Is it in hope to\\nfree them that thou art come hither? Nay, methinks, thou\\nthyself shalt never return but remain there with the\\nothers. Come then, I will redeem thee from thy distress,\\nand bring deliverance. Lo, take this herb of virtue, and go\\nto the dwelling of Circe, that it may keep from thy head\\nthe evil day. And I will tell thee all the magic sleight of\\nCirce. She will mix thee a potion and cast drugs into the\\nmess; but not even so shall she be able to enchant thee; so\\nhelpful is this charmed herb that I shall give thee, and I\\nwill tell thee all. When it shall be that Circe smites thee\\nwith her long wand, even then draw thou thy sharp sword\\nfrom thy thigh, and spring on her, as one eager to slay\\nher. And she will shrink away and be instant with thee to\\nlie with her. Thenceforth disdain not thou the bed of the\\ngoddess, that she may deliver thy company and kindly\\nentertain thee. But command her to swear a mighty oath by\\nthe blessed gods, that she will plan nought else of\\nmischief to thine own hurt, lest she make thee a dastard\\nand unmanned, when she hath thee naked.\"\\n\\n\\'Therewith the slayer of Argos gave me the plant that he\\nhad plucked from the ground, and he showed me the growth\\nthereof. It was black at the root, but the flower was like\\nto milk. Moly the gods call it, but it is hard for mortal\\nmen to dig; howbeit with the gods all things are possible.\\n\\n\\'Then Hermes departed toward high Olympus, up through the\\nwoodland isle, but as for me I held on my way to the house\\nof Circe, and my heart was darkly troubled as I went. So I\\nhalted in the portals of the fair-tressed goddess; there I\\nstood and called aloud and the goddess heard my voice, who\\npresently came forth and opened the shining doors and bade\\nme in, and I went with her heavy at heart. So she led me in\\nand set me on a chair with studs of silver, a goodly carven\\nchair, and beneath was a footstool for the feet. And she\\nmade me a potion in a golden cup, that I might drink, and\\nshe also put a charm therein, in the evil counsel of her\\nheart.\\n\\n\\'Now when she had given it and I had drunk it off and was\\nnot bewitched, she smote me with her wand and spake and\\nhailed me:\\n\\n\\'\"Go thy way now to the stye, couch thee there with the\\nrest of thy company.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, but I drew my sharp sword from my thigh and\\nsprang upon Circe, as one eager to slay her. But with a\\ngreat cry she slipped under, and clasped my knees, and\\nbewailing herself spake to me winged words:\\n\\n\\'\"Who art thou of the sons of men, and whence? Where is thy\\ncity? Where are they that begat thee? I marvel to see how\\nthou hast drunk of this charm, and wast nowise subdued.\\nNay, for there lives no man else that is proof against this\\ncharm, whoso hath drunk thereof, and once it hath passed\\nhis lips. But thou hast, methinks, a mind within thee that\\nmay not be enchanted. Verily thou art Odysseus, ready at\\nneed, whom he of the golden wand, the slayer of Argos, full\\noften told me was to come hither, on his way from Troy with\\nhis swift black ship. Nay come, put thy sword into the\\nsheath, and thereafter let us go up into my bed, that\\nmeeting in love and sleep we may trust each the other.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, but I answered her, saying: \"Nay, Circe, how\\ncanst thou bid me be gentle to thee, who hast turned my\\ncompany into swine within thy halls, and holding me here\\nwith a guileful heart requirest me to pass within thy\\nchamber and go up into thy bed, that so thou mayest make me\\na dastard and unmanned when thou hast me naked? Nay, never\\nwill I consent to go up into thy bed, except thou wilt\\ndeign, goddess, to swear a mighty oath, that thou wilt plan\\nnought else of mischief to mine own hurt.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and she straightway swore the oath not to harm\\nme, as I bade her. But when she had sworn and had done that\\noath, then at last I went up into the beautiful bed of\\nCirce.\\n\\n\\'Now all this while her handmaids busied them in the halls,\\nfour maidens that are her serving women in the house. They\\nare born of the wells and of the woods and of the holy\\nrivers, that flow forward into the salt sea. Of these one\\ncast upon the chairs goodly coverlets of purple above, and\\nspread a linen cloth thereunder. And lo, another drew up\\nsilver tables to the chairs, and thereon set for them\\ngolden baskets. And a third mixed sweet honey-hearted wine\\nin a silver bowl, and set out cups of gold. And a fourth\\nbare water, and kindled a great fire beneath the mighty\\ncauldron. So the water waxed warm; but when it boiled in\\nthe bright brazen vessel, she set me in a bath and bathed\\nme with water from out a great cauldron, pouring it over\\nhead and shoulders, when she had mixed it to a pleasant\\nwarmth, till from my limbs she took away the consuming\\nweariness. Now after she had bathed me and anointed me well\\nwith olive oil, and cast about me a fair mantle and a\\ndoublet, she led me into the halls and set me on a chair\\nwith studs of silver, a goodly carven chair, and beneath\\nwas a footstool for the feet. And a handmaid bare water for\\nthe hands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured it forth over\\na silver basin to wash withal; and to my side she drew a\\npolished table, and a grave dame bare wheaten bread and set\\nit by me, and laid on the board many dainties, giving\\nfreely of such things as she had by her. And she bade me\\neat, but my soul found no pleasure therein. I sat with\\nother thoughts, and my heart had a boding of ill.\\n\\n\\'Now when Circe saw that I sat thus, and that I put not\\nforth my hands to the meat, and that I was mightily\\nafflicted, she drew near to me and spake to me winged\\nwords:\\n\\n\\'\"Wherefore thus, Odysseus, dost thou sit there like a\\nspeechless man, consuming thine own soul, and dost not\\ntouch meat nor drink? Dost thou indeed deem there is some\\nfurther guile? Nay, thou hast no cause to fear, for already\\nI have sworn thee a strong oath not to harm thee.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, but I answered her, saying: \"Oh, Circe, what\\nrighteous man would have the heart to taste meat and drink\\nere he had redeemed his company, and beheld them face to\\nface? But if in good faith thou biddest me eat and drink,\\nthen let them go free, that mine eyes may behold my dear\\ncompanions.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and Circe passed out through the hall with the\\nwand in her hand, and opened the doors of the stye, and\\ndrave them forth in the shape of swine of nine seasons old.\\nThere they stood before her, and she went through their\\nmidst, and anointed each one of them with another charm.\\nAnd lo, from their limbs the bristles dropped away,\\nwherewith the venom had erewhile clothed them, that lady\\nCirce gave them. And they became men again, younger than\\nbefore they were, and goodlier far, and taller to behold.\\nAnd they all knew me again and each one took my hands, and\\nwistful was the lament that sank into their souls, and the\\nroof around rang wondrously. And even the goddess herself\\nwas moved with compassion.\\n\\n\\'Then standing nigh me the fair goddess spake unto me: \"Son\\nof Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,\\ndepart now to thy swift ship and the sea-banks. And first\\nof all, draw ye up the ship ashore, and bestow the goods in\\nthe caves and all the gear. And thyself return again, and\\nbring with thee thy dear companions.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, and my lordly spirit consented thereto. So I\\nwent on my way to the swift ship and the sea-banks, and\\nthere I found my dear company on the swift ship lamenting\\npiteously, shedding big tears. And as when calves of the\\nhomestead gather round the droves of kine that have\\nreturned to the yard, when they have had their fill of\\npasture, and all with one accord frisk before them, and the\\nfolds may no more contain them, but with a ceaseless lowing\\nthey skip about their dams, so flocked they all about me\\nweeping, when their eyes beheld me. Yea, and to their\\nspirit it was as though they had got to their dear country,\\nand the very city of rugged Ithaca, where they were born\\nand reared.\\n\\n\\'Then making lament they spake to me winged words: \"O\\nfosterling of Zeus, we were none otherwise glad at thy\\nreturning, than if we had come to Ithaca, our own country.\\nNay come, of our other companions tell us the tale of their\\nruin.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake they, but I answered them with soft words:\\n\"Behold, let us first of all draw up the ship ashore, and\\nbestow our goods in the caves and all our gear. And do ye\\nbestir you, one and all, to go with me, that ye may see\\nyour fellows in the sacred dwelling of Circe, eating and\\ndrinking, for they have continual store.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and at once they hearkened to my words, but\\nEurylochus alone would have holden all my companions, and\\nuttering his voice he spake to them winged words:\\n\\n\\'\"Wretched men that we are! whither are we going? Why are\\nyour hearts so set on sorrow that ye should go down to the\\nhall of Circe, who will surely change us all to swine, or\\nwolves, or lions, to guard her great house perforce,\\naccording to the deeds that the Cyclops wrought, when\\ncertain of our company went to his inmost fold, and with\\nthem went Odysseus, ever hardy, for through the blindness\\nof his heart did they too perish?\"\\n\\n\\'So spake he, but I mused in my heart whether to draw my\\nlong hanger from my stout thigh, and therewith smite off\\nhis head and bring it to the dust, albeit he was very near\\nof kin to me; but the men of my company stayed me on every\\nside with soothing words:\\n\\n\\'\"Prince of the seed of Zeus, as for this man, we will\\nsuffer him, if thou wilt have it so, to abide here by the\\nship and guard the ship; but as for us, be our guide to the\\nsacred house of Circe.\"\\n\\n\\'So they spake and went up from the ship and the sea. Nay,\\nnor yet was Eurylochus left by the hollow ship, but he went\\nwith us, for he feared my terrible rebuke.\\n\\n\\'Meanwhile Circe bathed the rest of my company in her halls\\nwith all care, and anointed them well with olive oil; and\\ncast thick mantles and doublets about them. And we found\\nthem all feasting nobly in the halls. And when they saw and\\nknew each other face to face, they wept and mourned, and\\nthe house rang around. Then she stood near me, that fair\\ngoddess, and spake saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many\\ndevices, no more now wake this plenteous weeping: myself I\\nknow of all the pains ye endured upon the teeming deep, and\\nthe great despite done you by unkindly men upon the land.\\nNay come, eat ye meat and drink wine, till your spirit\\nshall return to you again, as it was when first ye left\\nyour own country of rugged Ithaca; but now are ye wasted\\nand wanting heart, mindful evermore of your sore wandering,\\nnor has your heart ever been merry, for very grievous hath\\nbeen your trial.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, and our lordly spirit consented thereto. So\\nthere we sat day by day for the full circle of a year,\\nfeasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine. But when now a\\nyear had gone, and the seasons returned as the months\\nwaned, and the long days came in their course, then did my\\ndear company call me forth, and say:\\n\\n\\'\"Good sir, now is it high time to mind thee of thy native\\nland, if it is ordained that thou shalt be saved, and come\\nto thy lofty house and thine own country.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake they and my lordly spirit consented thereto. So\\nfor that time we sat the livelong day till the going down\\nof the sun, feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine. But\\nwhen the sun sank and darkness came on, they laid them to\\nrest throughout the shadowy halls.\\n\\n\\'But when I had gone up into the fair bed of Circe, I\\nbesought her by her knees, and the goddess heard my speech,\\nand uttering my voice I spake to her winged words: \"Circe,\\nfulfil for me the promise which thou madest me to send me\\non my homeward way. Now is my spirit eager to be gone, and\\nthe spirit of my company, that wear away my heart as they\\nmourn around me, when haply thou art gone from us.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and the fair goddess answered me anon: \"Son of\\nLaertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,\\ntarry ye now no longer in my house against your will; but\\nfirst must ye perform another journey, and reach the\\ndwelling of Hades and of dread Persephone to seek to the\\nspirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind soothsayer, whose\\nwits abide steadfast. To him Persephone hath given\\njudgment, even in death, that he alone should have\\nunderstanding; but the other souls sweep shadow-like\\naround.\"\\n\\n\\'Thus spake she, but as for me, my heart was broken, and I\\nwept as I sat upon the bed, and my soul had no more care to\\nlive and to see the sunlight. But when I had my fill of\\nweeping and grovelling, then at the last I answered and\\nspake unto her saying: \"And who, Circe, will guide us on\\nthis way? for no man ever yet sailed to hell in a black\\nship.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and the fair goddess answered me anon: \"Son of\\nLaertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,\\nnay, trouble not thyself for want of a guide, by thy ship\\nabiding, but set up the mast and spread abroad the white\\nsails and sit thee down; and the breeze of the North Wind\\nwill bear thy vessel on her way. But when thou hast now\\nsailed in thy ship across the stream Oceanus, where is a\\nwaste shore and the groves of Persephone, even tall poplar\\ntrees and willows that shed their fruit before the season,\\nthere beach thy ship by deep eddying Oceanus, but go\\nthyself to the dank house of Hades. Thereby into Acheron\\nflows Pyriphlegethon, and Cocytus, a branch of the water of\\nthe Styx, and there is a rock, and the meeting of the two\\nroaring waters. So, hero, draw nigh thereto, as I command\\nthee, and dig a trench as it were a cubit in length and\\nbreadth, and about it pour a drink-offering to all the\\ndead, first with mead and thereafter with sweet wine, and\\nfor the third time with water, and sprinkle white meal\\nthereon; and entreat with many prayers the strengthless\\nheads of the dead, and promise that on thy return to Ithaca\\nthou wilt offer in thy halls a barren heifer, the best thou\\nhast, and will fill the pyre with treasure, and wilt\\nsacrifice apart, to Teiresias alone, a black ram without\\nspot, the fairest of your flock. But when thou hast with\\nprayers made supplication to the lordly races of the dead,\\nthen offer up a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads\\ntowards Erebus and thyself turn thy back, with thy face set\\nfor the shore of the river. Then will many spirits come to\\nthee of the dead that be departed. Thereafter thou shalt\\ncall to thy company and command them to flay the sheep\\nwhich even now lie slain by the pitiless sword, and to\\nconsume them with fire, and to make prayer to the gods, to\\nmighty Hades and to dread Persephone. And thyself draw the\\nsharp sword from thy thigh and sit there, suffering not the\\nstrengthless heads of the dead to draw nigh to the blood,\\nere thou hast word of Teiresias. Then the seer will come to\\nthee quickly, leader of the people; he will surely declare\\nto thee the way and the measure of thy path, and as\\ntouching thy returning, how thou mayst go over the teeming\\ndeep.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, and anon came the golden throned Dawn. Then\\nshe put on me a mantle and a doublet for raiment, and the\\nnymph clad herself in a great shining robe, light of woof\\nand gracious, and about her waist she cast a fair golden\\ngirdle, and put a veil upon her head. But I passed through\\nthe halls and roused my men with smooth words, standing by\\neach one in turn:\\n\\n\\'\"Sleep ye now no more nor breathe sweet slumber; but let\\nus go on our way, for surely she hath shown me all, the\\nlady Circe.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and their lordly soul consented thereto. Yet\\neven thence I led not my company safe away. There was one,\\nElpenor, the youngest of us all, not very valiant in war\\nneither steadfast in mind. He was lying apart from the rest\\nof my men on the housetop of Circe\\'s sacred dwelling, very\\nfain of the cool air, as one heavy with wine. Now when he\\nheard the noise of the voices and of the feet of my fellows\\nas they moved to and fro, he leaped up of a sudden and\\nminded him not to descend again by the way of the tall\\nladder, but fell right down from the roof, and his neck was\\nbroken from the bones of the spine, and his spirit went\\ndown to the house of Hades.\\n\\n\\'Then I spake among my men as they went on their way,\\nsaying: \"Ye deem now, I see, that ye are going to your own\\ndear country; but Circe hath showed us another way, even to\\nthe dwelling of Hades and of dread Persephone, to seek to\\nthe spirit of Theban Teiresias.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so I spake, but their heart within them was broken,\\nand they sat them down even where they were, and made\\nlament and tore their hair. Howbeit no help came of their\\nweeping.\\n\\n\\'But as we were now wending sorrowful to the swift ship and\\nthe sea-banks, shedding big tears, Circe meanwhile had gone\\nher ways and made fast a ram and a black ewe by the dark\\nship, lightly passing us by: who may behold a god against\\nhis will, whether going to or fro?\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XI\\n\\n  Odysseus, his descent into hell, and discourses with the\\n  ghosts of the deceased heroes.\\n\\n\\'Now when we had gone down to the ship and to the sea,\\nfirst of all we drew the ship unto the fair salt water and\\nplaced the mast and sails in the black ship, and took those\\nsheep and put them therein, and ourselves too climbed on\\nboard, sorrowing, and shedding big tears. And in the wake\\nof our dark-prowed ship she sent a favouring wind that\\nfilled the sails, a kindly escort,--even Circe of the\\nbraided tresses, a dread goddess of human speech. And we\\nset in order all the gear throughout the ship and sat us\\ndown; and the wind and the helmsman guided our barque. And\\nall day long her sails were stretched in her seafaring; and\\nthe sun sank and all the ways were darkened.\\n\\n\\'She came to the limits of the world, to the deep-flowing\\nOceanus. There is the land and the city of the Cimmerians,\\nshrouded in mist and cloud, and never does the shining sun\\nlook down on them with his rays, neither when he climbs up\\nthe starry heavens, nor when again he turns earthward from\\nthe firmament, but deadly night is outspread over miserable\\nmortals. Thither we came and ran the ship ashore and took\\nout the sheep; but for our part we held on our way along\\nthe stream of Oceanus, till we came to the place which\\nCirce had declared to us.\\n\\n\\'There Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, but I\\ndrew my sharp sword from my thigh, and dug a pit, as it\\nwere a cubit in length and breadth, and about it poured a\\ndrink-offering to all the dead, first with mead and\\nthereafter with sweet wine, and for the third time with\\nwater. And I sprinkled white meal thereon, and entreated\\nwith many prayers the strengthless heads of the dead, and\\npromised that on my return to Ithaca I would offer in my\\nhalls a barren heifer, the best I had, and fill the pyre\\nwith treasure, and apart unto Teiresias alone sacrifice a\\nblack ram without spot, the fairest of my flock. But when I\\nhad besought the tribes of the dead with vows and prayers,\\nI took the sheep and cut their throats over the trench, and\\nthe dark blood flowed forth, and lo, the spirits of the\\ndead that be departed gathered them from out of Erebus.\\nBrides and youths unwed, and old men of many and evil days,\\nand tender maidens with grief yet fresh at heart; and many\\nthere were, wounded with bronze-shod spears, men slain in\\nfight with their bloody mail about them. And these many\\nghosts flocked together from every side about the trench\\nwith a wondrous cry, and pale fear gat hold on me. Then did\\nI speak to my company and command them to flay the sheep\\nthat lay slain by the pitiless sword, and to consume them\\nwith fire, and to make prayer to the gods, to mighty Hades\\nand to dread Persephone, and myself I drew the sharp sword\\nfrom my thigh and sat there, suffering not the strengthless\\nheads of the dead to draw nigh to the blood, ere I had word\\nof Teiresias.\\n\\n\\'And first came the soul of Elpenor, my companion, that had\\nnot yet been buried beneath the wide-wayed earth; for we\\nleft the corpse behind us in the hall of Circe, unwept and\\nunburied, seeing that another task was instant on us. At\\nthe sight of him I wept and had compassion on him, and\\nuttering my voice spake to him winged words: \"Elpenor, how\\nhast thou come beneath the darkness and the shadow? Thou\\nhast come fleeter on foot than I in my black ship.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and with a moan he answered me, saying: \"Son\\nof Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,\\nan evil doom of some god was my bane and wine out of\\nmeasure. When I laid me down on the house-top of Circe I\\nminded me not to descend again by the way of the tall\\nladder, but fell right down from the roof, and my neck was\\nbroken off from the bones of the spine, and my spirit went\\ndown to the house of Hades. And now I pray thee in the name\\nof those whom we left, who are no more with us, thy wife,\\nand thy sire who cherished thee when as yet thou wert a\\nlittle one, and Telemachus, whom thou didst leave in thy\\nhalls alone; forasmuch as I know that on thy way hence from\\nout the dwelling of Hades, thou wilt stay thy well-wrought\\nship at the isle Aeaean, even then, my lord, I charge thee\\nto think on me. Leave me not unwept and unburied as thou\\ngoest hence, nor turn thy back upon me, lest haply I bring\\non thee the anger of the gods. Nay, burn me there with mine\\narmour, all that is mine, and pile me a barrow on the shore\\nof the grey sea, the grave of a luckless man, that even men\\nunborn may hear my story. Fulfil me this and plant upon the\\nbarrow mine oar, wherewith I rowed in the days of my life,\\nwhile yet I was among my fellows.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so he spake, and I answered him saying: \"All this,\\nluckless man, will I perform for thee and do.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so we twain were sitting holding sad discourse, I on\\nthe one side, stretching forth my sword over the blood,\\nwhile on the other side the ghost of my friend told all his\\ntale.\\n\\n\\'Anon came up the soul of my mother dead, Anticleia, the\\ndaughter of Autolycus the great-hearted, whom I left alive\\nwhen I departed for sacred Ilios. At the sight of her I\\nwept, and was moved with compassion, yet even so, for all\\nmy sore grief, I suffered her not to draw nigh to the\\nblood, ere I had word of Teiresias.\\n\\n\\'Anon came the soul of Theban Teiresias, with a golden\\nsceptre in his hand, and he knew me and spake unto me: \"Son\\nof Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,\\nwhat seekest thou NOW, wretched man, wherefore hast thou\\nleft the sunlight and come hither to behold the dead and a\\nland desolate of joy? Nay, hold off from the ditch and draw\\nback thy sharp sword, that I may drink of the blood and\\ntell thee sooth.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake he and I put up my silver-studded sword into the\\nsheath, and when he had drunk the dark blood, even then did\\nthe noble seer speak unto me, saying: \"Thou art asking of\\nthy sweet returning, great Odysseus, but that will the god\\nmake hard for thee; for methinks thou shalt not pass\\nunheeded by the Shaker of the Earth, who hath laid up wrath\\nin his heart against thee, for rage at the blinding of his\\ndear son. Yet even so, through many troubles, ye may come\\nhome, if thou wilt restrain thy spirit and the spirit of\\nthy men so soon as thou shalt bring thy well-wrought ship\\nnigh to the isle Thrinacia, fleeing the sea of violet blue,\\nwhen ye find the herds of Helios grazing and his brave\\nflocks, of Helios who overseeth all and overheareth all\\nthings. If thou doest these no hurt, being heedful of thy\\nreturn, so may ye yet reach Ithaca, albeit in evil case.\\nBut if thou hurtest them, I foreshow ruin for thy ship and\\nfor thy men, and even though thou shalt thyself escape,\\nlate shalt thou return in evil plight, with the loss of all\\nthy company, on board the ship of strangers, and thou shalt\\nfind sorrows in thy house, even proud men that devour thy\\nliving, while they woo thy godlike wife and offer the gifts\\nof wooing. Yet I tell thee, on thy coming thou shalt avenge\\ntheir violence. But when thou hast slain the wooers in thy\\nhalls, whether by guile, or openly with the edge of the\\nsword, thereafter go thy way, taking with thee a shapen\\noar, till thou shalt come to such men as know not the sea,\\nneither eat meat savoured with salt; yea, nor have they\\nknowledge of ships of purple cheek, nor shapen oars which\\nserve for wings to ships. And I will give thee a most\\nmanifest token, which cannot escape thee. In the day when\\nanother wayfarer shall meet thee and say that thou hast a\\nwinnowing fan on thy stout shoulder, even then make fast\\nthy shapen oar in the earth and do goodly sacrifice to the\\nlord Poseidon, even with a ram and a bull and a boar, the\\nmate of swine, and depart for home and offer holy hecatombs\\nto the deathless gods that keep the wide heaven, to each in\\norder due. And from the sea shall thine own death come, the\\ngentlest death that may be, which shall end thee foredone\\nwith smooth old age, and the folk shall dwell happily\\naround thee. This that I say is sooth.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake he, and I answered him, saying: \"Teiresias, all\\nthese threads, methinks, the gods themselves have spun. But\\ncome, declare me this and plainly tell me all. I see here\\nthe spirit of my mother dead; lo, she sits in silence near\\nthe blood, nor deigns to look her son in the face nor speak\\nto him! Tell me, prince, how may she know me again that I\\nam he?\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and anon he answered me, and said: \"I will\\ntell thee an easy saying, and will put it in thy heart.\\nWhomsoever of the dead that be departed thou shalt suffer\\nto draw nigh to the blood, he shall tell thee sooth; but if\\nthou shalt grudge any, that one shall go to his own place\\nagain.\" Therewith the spirit of the prince Teiresias went\\nback within the house of Hades, when he had told all his\\noracles. But I abode there steadfastly, till my mother drew\\nnigh and drank the dark blood; and at once she knew me, and\\nbewailing herself spake to me winged words:\\n\\n\\'\"Dear child, how didst thou come beneath the darkness and\\nthe shadow, thou that art a living man? Grievous is the\\nsight of these things to the living, for between us and you\\nare great rivers and dreadful streams; first, Oceanus,\\nwhich can no wise be crossed on foot, but only if one have\\na well wrought ship. Art thou but now come hither with thy\\nship and thy company in thy long wanderings from Troy? and\\nhast thou not yet reached Ithaca, nor seen thy wife in thy\\nhalls?\"\\n\\n\\'Even so she spake, and I answered her, and said: \"O my\\nmother, necessity was on me to come down to the house of\\nHades to seek to the spirit of Theban Teiresias. For not\\nyet have I drawn near to the Achaean shore, nor yet have I\\nset foot on mine own country, but have been wandering\\nevermore in affliction, from the day that first I went with\\ngoodly Agamemnon to Ilios of the fair steeds, to do battle\\nwith the Trojans. But come, declare me this and plainly\\ntell it all. What doom overcame thee of death that lays men\\nat their length? Was it a slow disease, or did Artemis the\\narcher slay thee with the visitation of her gentle shafts?\\nAnd tell me of my father and my son, that I left behind me;\\ndoth my honour yet abide with them, or hath another already\\ntaken it, while they say that I shall come home no more?\\nAnd tell me of my wedded wife, of her counsel and her\\npurpose, doth she abide with her son and keep all secure,\\nor hath she already wedded the best of the Achaeans?\"\\n\\n\\'Even so I spake, and anon my lady mother answered me: \"Yea\\nverily, she abideth with steadfast spirit in thy halls; and\\nwearily for her the nights wane always and the days in\\nshedding of tears. But the fair honour that is thine no man\\nhath yet taken; but Telemachus sits at peace on his\\ndemesne, and feasts at equal banquets, whereof it is meet\\nthat a judge partake, for all men bid him to their house.\\nAnd thy father abides there in the field, and goes not down\\nto the town, nor lies he on bedding or rugs or shining\\nblankets, but all the winter he sleeps, where sleep the\\nthralls in the house, in the ashes by the fire, and is clad\\nin sorry raiment. But when the summer comes and the rich\\nharvest-tide, his beds of fallen leaves are strewn lowly\\nall about the knoll of his vineyard plot. There he lies\\nsorrowing and nurses his mighty grief, for long desire of\\nthy return, and old age withal comes heavy upon him. Yea\\nand even so did I too perish and meet my doom. It was not\\nthe archer goddess of the keen sight, who slew me in my\\nhalls with the visitation of her gentle shafts, nor did any\\nsickness come upon me, such as chiefly with a sad wasting\\ndraws the spirit from the limbs; nay, it was my sore\\nlonging for thee, and for thy counsels, great Odysseus, and\\nfor thy loving-kindness, that reft me of sweet life.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, and I mused in my heart and would fain have\\nembraced the spirit of my mother dead. Thrice I sprang\\ntowards her, and was minded to embrace her; thrice she\\nflitted from my hands as a shadow or even as a dream, and\\nsharp grief arose ever at my heart. And uttering my voice I\\nspake to her winged words:\\n\\n\\'\"Mother mine, wherefore dost thou not abide me who am\\neager to clasp thee, that even in Hades we twain may cast\\nour arms each about the other, and have our fill of chill\\nlament? Is this but a phantom that the high goddess\\nPersephone hath sent me, to the end that I may groan for\\nmore exceeding sorrow?\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and my lady mother answered me anon: \"Ah me,\\nmy child, of all men most ill-fated, Persephone, the\\ndaughter of Zeus, doth in no wise deceive thee, but even on\\nthis wise it is with mortals when they die. For the sinews\\nno more bind together the flesh and the bones, but the\\ngreat force of burning fire abolishes these, so soon as the\\nlife hath left the white bones, and the spirit like a dream\\nflies forth and hovers near. But haste with all thine heart\\ntoward the sunlight, and mark all this, that even hereafter\\nthou mayest tell it to thy wife.\"\\n\\n\\'Thus we twain held discourse together; and lo, the women\\ncame up, for the high goddess Persephone sent them forth,\\nall they that had been the wives and daughters of mighty\\nmen. And they gathered and flocked about the black blood,\\nand I took counsel how I might question them each one. And\\nthis was the counsel that showed best in my sight. I drew\\nmy long hanger from my stalwart thigh, and suffered them\\nnot all at one time to drink of the dark blood. So they\\ndrew nigh one by one, and each declared her lineage, and I\\nmade question of all.\\n\\n\\'Then verily did I first see Tyro, sprung of a noble sire,\\nwho said that she was the child of noble Salmoneus, and\\ndeclared herself the wife of Cretheus, son of Aeolus. She\\nloved a river, the divine Enipeus, far the fairest of the\\nfloods that run upon the earth, and she would resort to the\\nfair streams of Enipeus. And it came to pass that the\\ngirdler of the world, the Earth-shaker, put on the shape of\\nthe god, and lay by the lady at the mouths of the whirling\\nstream. Then the dark wave stood around them like a\\nhill-side bowed, and hid the god and the mortal woman. And\\nhe undid her maiden girdle, and shed a slumber over her.\\nNow when the god had done the work of love, he clasped her\\nhand and spake and hailed her:\\n\\n\\'\"Woman, be glad in our love, and when the year comes round\\nthou shalt give birth to glorious children,--for not weak\\nare the embraces of the gods,--and do thou keep and cherish\\nthem. And now go home and hold thy peace, and tell it not:\\nbut behold, I am Poseidon, shaker of the earth.\"\\n\\n\\'Therewith he plunged beneath the heaving deep. And she\\nconceived and bare Pelias and Neleus, who both grew to be\\nmighty men, servants of Zeus. Pelias dwelt in wide Iolcos,\\nand was rich in flocks; and that other abode in sandy\\nPylos. And the queen of women bare yet other sons to\\nCretheus, even Aeson and Pheres and Amythaon, whose joy was\\nin chariots.\\n\\n\\'And after her I saw Antiope, daughter of Asopus, and her\\nboast was that she had slept even in the arms of Zeus, and\\nshe bare two sons, Amphion and Zethus, who founded first\\nthe place of seven-gated Thebes, and they made of it a\\nfenced city, for they might not dwell in spacious Thebes\\nunfenced, for all their valiancy.\\n\\n\\'Next to her I saw Alcmene, wife of Amphitryon, who lay in\\nthe arms of mighty Zeus, and bare Heracles of the\\nlion-heart, steadfast in the fight. And I saw Megara,\\ndaughter of Creon, haughty of heart, whom the strong and\\ntireless son of Amphitryon had to wife.\\n\\n\\'And I saw the mother of Oedipodes, fair Epicaste, who\\nwrought a dread deed unwittingly, being wedded to her own\\nson, and he that had slain his own father wedded her, and\\nstraightway the gods made these things known to men. Yet he\\nabode in pain in pleasant Thebes, ruling the Cadmaeans, by\\nreason of the deadly counsels of the gods. But she went\\ndown to the house of Hades, the mighty warder; yea, she\\ntied a noose from the high beam aloft, being fast holden in\\nsorrow; while for him she left pains behind full many, even\\nall that the Avengers of a mother bring to pass.\\n\\n\\'And I saw lovely Chloris, whom Neleus wedded on a time for\\nher beauty, and brought gifts of wooing past number. She\\nwas the youngest daughter of Amphion, son of Iasus, who\\nonce ruled mightily in Minyan Orchomenus. And she was queen\\nof Pylos, and bare glorious children to her lord, Nestor\\nand Chromius, and princely Periclymenus, and stately Pero\\ntoo, the wonder of all men. All that dwelt around were her\\nwooers; but Neleus would not give her, save to him who\\nshould drive off from Phylace the kine of mighty Iphicles,\\nwith shambling gait and broad of brow, hard cattle to\\ndrive. And none but the noble seer {*} took in hand to\\ndrive them; but a grievous fate from the gods fettered him,\\neven hard bonds and the herdsmen of the wild. But when at\\nlength the months and days were being fulfilled, as the\\nyear returned upon his course, and the seasons came round,\\nthen did mighty Iphicles set him free, when he had spoken\\nout all the oracles; and herein was the counsel of Zeus\\nbeing accomplished.\\n\\n{* Melampus}\\n\\n\\'And I saw Lede, the famous bed-fellow of Tyndareus, who\\nbare to Tyndareus two sons, hardy of heart, Castor tamer of\\nsteeds, and Polydeuces the boxer. These twain yet live, but\\nthe quickening earth is over them; and even in the nether\\nworld they have honour at the hand of Zeus. And they\\npossess their life in turn, living one day and dying the\\nnext, and they have gotten worship even as the gods.\\n\\n\\'And after her I beheld Iphimedeia, bed-fellow of Aloeus,\\nwho said that she had lain with Poseidon, and she bare\\nchildren twain, but short of life were they, godlike Otus\\nand far-famed Ephialtes. Now these were the tallest men\\nthat earth, the graingiver, ever reared, and far the\\ngoodliest after the renowned Orion. At nine seasons old\\nthey were of breadth nine cubits, and nine fathoms in\\nheight. They it was who threatened to raise even against\\nthe immortals in Olympus the din of stormy war. They strove\\nto pile Ossa on Olympus, and on Ossa Pelion with the\\ntrembling forest leaves, that there might be a pathway to\\nthe sky. Yea, and they would have accomplished it, had they\\nreached the full measure of manhood. But the son of Zeus,\\nwhom Leto of the fair locks bare, destroyed the twain, ere\\nthe down had bloomed beneath their temples, and darkened\\ntheir chins with the blossom of youth.\\n\\n\\'And Phaedra and Procris I saw, and fair Ariadne, the\\ndaughter of wizard Minos, whom Theseus on a time was\\nbearing from Crete to the hill of sacred Athens, yet had he\\nno joy of her; for Artemis slew her ere that in sea-girt\\nDia, by reason of the witness of Dionysus.\\n\\n\\'And Maera and Clymene I saw, and hateful Eriphyle, who\\ntook fine gold for the price of her dear lord\\'s life. But I\\ncannot tell or name all the wives and daughters of the\\nheroes that I saw; ere that, the immortal night would wane.\\nNay, it is even now time to sleep, whether I go to the\\nswift ship to my company or abide here: and for my convoy\\nyou and the gods will care.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and dead silence fell on all, and they were\\nspell-bound throughout the shadowy halls. Then Arete of the\\nwhite arms first spake among them: \\'Phaeacians, what think\\nyou of this man for comeliness and stature, and within for\\nwisdom of heart? Moreover he is my guest, though every one\\nof you hath his share in this honour. Wherefore haste not\\nto send him hence, and stint not these your gifts for one\\nthat stands in such sore need of them; for ye have much\\ntreasure stored in your halls by the grace of the gods.\\'\\n\\nThen too spake among them the old man, lord Echeneus, that\\nwas an elder among the Phaeacians: \\'Friends, behold, the\\nspeech of our wise queen is not wide of the mark, nor far\\nfrom our deeming, so hearken ye thereto. But on Alcinous\\nhere both word and work depend.\\'\\n\\nThen Alcinous made answer, and spake unto him: \\'Yea, the\\nword that she hath spoken shall hold, if indeed I am yet to\\nlive and bear rule among the Phaeacians, masters of the\\noar. Howbeit let the stranger, for all his craving to\\nreturn, nevertheless endure to abide until the morrow, till\\nI make up the full measure of the gift; and men shall care\\nfor his convoy, all men, but I in chief, for mine is the\\nlordship in the land.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him, saying: My lord\\nAlcinous, most notable of all the people, if ye bade me\\ntarry here even for a year, and would speed my convoy and\\ngive me splendid gifts, even that I would choose; and\\nbetter would it be for me to come with a fuller hand to\\nmine own dear country, so should I get more love and\\nworship in the eyes of all men, whoso should see me after I\\nwas returned to Ithaca.\\'\\n\\nAnd Alcinous answered him, saying: \\'Odysseus, in no wise do\\nwe deem thee, we that look on thee, to be a knave or a\\ncheat, even as the dark earth rears many such broadcast,\\nfashioning lies whence none can even see his way therein.\\nBut beauty crowns thy words, and wisdom is within thee; and\\nthy tale, as when a minstrel sings, thou hast told with\\nskill, the weary woes of all the Argives and of thine own\\nself. But come, declare me this and plainly tell it all.\\nDidst thou see any of thy godlike company who went up at\\nthe same time with thee to Ilios and there met their doom?\\nBehold, the night is of great length, unspeakable, and the\\ntime for sleep in the hall is not yet; tell me therefore of\\nthose wondrous deeds. I could abide even till the bright\\ndawn, so long as thou couldst endure to rehearse me these\\nwoes of thine in the hall.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him, saying: \\'My\\nlord Alcinous, most notable of all the people, there is a\\ntime for many words and there is a time for sleep. But if\\nthou art eager still to listen, I would not for my part\\ngrudge to tell thee of other things more pitiful still,\\neven the woes of my comrades, those that perished\\nafterward, for they had escaped with their lives from the\\ndread war-cry of the Trojans, but perished in returning by\\nthe will of an evil woman.\\n\\n\\'Now when holy Persephone had scattered this way and that\\nthe spirits of the women folk, thereafter came the soul of\\nAgamemnon, son of Atreus, sorrowing; and round him others\\nwere gathered, the ghosts of them who had died with him in\\nthe house of Aegisthus and met their doom. And he knew me\\nstraightway when he had drunk the dark blood, yea, and he\\nwept aloud, and shed big tears as he stretched forth his\\nhands in his longing to reach me. But it might not be, for\\nhe had now no steadfast strength nor power at all in\\nmoving, such as was aforetime in his supple limbs.\\n\\n\\'At the sight of him I wept and was moved with compassion,\\nand uttering my voice, spake to him winged words: \"Most\\nrenowned son of Atreus, Agamemnon, king of men, say what\\ndoom overcame thee of death that lays men at their length?\\nDid Poseidon smite thee in thy ships, raising the dolorous\\nblast of contrary winds, or did unfriendly men do thee hurt\\nupon the land, whilst thou wert cutting off their oxen and\\nfair flocks of sheep, or fighting to win a city and the\\nwomen thereof?\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and straightway he answered, and said unto me:\\n\"Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many\\ndevices, it was not Poseidon that smote me in my ships, and\\nraised the dolorous blast of contrary winds, nor did\\nunfriendly men do me hurt upon the land, but Aegisthus it\\nwas that wrought me death and doom and slew me, with the\\naid of my accursed wife, as one slays an ox at the stall,\\nafter he had bidden me to his house, and entertained me at\\na feast. Even so I died by a death most pitiful, and round\\nme my company likewise were slain without ceasing, like\\nswine with glittering tusks which are slaughtered in the\\nhouse of a rich and mighty man, whether at a wedding\\nbanquet or a joint-feast or a rich clan-drinking. Ere now\\nhast thou been at the slaying of many a man, killed in\\nsingle fight or in strong battle, yet thou wouldst have\\nsorrowed the most at this sight, how we lay in the hall\\nround the mixing-bowl and the laden boards, and the floor\\nall ran with blood. And most pitiful of all that I heard\\nwas the voice of the daughter of Priam, of Cassandra, whom\\nhard by me the crafty Clytemnestra slew. Then I strove to\\nraise my hands as I was dying upon the sword, but to earth\\nthey fell. And that shameless one turned her back upon me,\\nand had not the heart to draw down my eyelids with her\\nfingers nor to close my mouth. So surely is there nought\\nmore terrible and shameless than a woman who imagines such\\nevil in her heart, even as she too planned a foul deed,\\nfashioning death for her wedded lord. Verily I had thought\\nto come home most welcome to my children and my thralls;\\nbut she, out of the depth of her evil knowledge, hath shed\\nshame on herself and on all womankind, which shall be for\\never, even on the upright.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so he spake, but I answered him, saying: \"Lo now, in\\nvery sooth, hath Zeus of the far-borne voice wreaked\\nwondrous hatred on the seed of Atreus through the counsels\\nof woman from of old. For Helen\\'s sake so many of us\\nperished, and now Clytemnestra hath practised treason\\nagainst thee, while yet thou wast afar off.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so I spake, and anon he answered me, saying:\\n\"Wherefore do thou too, never henceforth be soft even to\\nthy wife, neither show her all the counsel that thou\\nknowest, but a part declare and let part be hid. Yet shalt\\nnot thou, Odysseus, find death at the hand of thy wife, for\\nshe is very discreet and prudent in all her ways, the wise\\nPenelope, daughter of Icarius. Verily we left her a bride\\nnew wed when we went to the war, and a child was at her\\nbreast, who now, methinks, sits in the ranks of men, happy\\nin his lot, for his dear father shall behold him on his\\ncoming, and he shall embrace his sire as is meet. But us\\nfor my wife, she suffered me not so much as to have my fill\\nof gazing on my son; ere that she slew me, even her lord.\\nAnd yet another thing will I tell thee, and do thou ponder\\nit in thy heart. Put thy ship to land in secret, and not\\nopenly, on the shore of thy dear country; for there is no\\nmore faith in woman. But come, declare me this and plainly\\ntell it all, if haply ye hear of my son as yet living,\\neither, it may be, in Orchomenus or in sandy Pylos, or\\nperchance with Menelaus in wide Sparta, for goodly Orestes\\nhath not yet perished on the earth.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so he spake, but I answered him, saying: \"Son of\\nAtreus, wherefore dost thou ask me straitly of these\\nthings? Nay I know not at all, whether he be alive or dead;\\nit is ill to speak words light as wind.\"\\n\\n\\'Thus we twain stood sorrowing, holding sad discourse,\\nwhile the big tears fell fast: and therewithal came the\\nsoul of Achilles, son of Peleus, and of Patroclus and of\\nnoble Antilochus and of Aias, who in face and form was\\ngoodliest of all the Danaans, after the noble son of\\nPeleus. And the spirit of the son of Aeacus, fleet of foot,\\nknew me again, and making lament spake to me winged words:\\n\\n\\'\"Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many\\ndevices, man overbold, what new deed and hardier than this\\nwilt thou devise in thy heart? How durst thou come down to\\nthe house of Hades, where dwell the senseless dead, the\\nphantoms of men outworn?\"\\n\\n\\'So he spake, but I answered him: \"Achilles, son of Peleus,\\nmightiest far of the Achaeans, I am come hither to seek to\\nTeiresias, if he may tell me any counsel, how I may come to\\nrugged Ithaca. For not yet have I come nigh the Achaean\\nland, nor set foot on mine own soil, but am still in evil\\ncase; while as for thee, Achilles, none other than thou\\nwast heretofore the most blessed of men, nor shall any be\\nhereafter. For of old, in the days of thy life, we Argives\\ngave thee one honour with the gods, and now thou art a\\ngreat prince here among the dead. Wherefore let not thy\\ndeath be any grief to thee, Achilles.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so I spake, and he straightway answered me, and said:\\n\"Nay, speak not comfortably to me of death, oh great\\nOdysseus. Rather would I live on ground {*} as the hireling\\nof another, with a landless man who had no great\\nlivelihood, than bear sway among all the dead that be\\ndeparted. But come, tell me tidings of that lordly son of\\nmine--did he follow to the war to be a leader or not? And\\ntell me of noble Peleus, if thou hast heard aught,--is he\\nyet held in worship among the Myrmidons, or do they\\ndishonour him from Hellas to Phthia, for that old age binds\\nhim hand and foot? For I am no longer his champion under\\nthe sun, so mighty a man as once I was, when in wide Troy I\\nslew the best of the host, and succoured the Argives. Ah!\\ncould I but come for an hour to my father\\'s house as then I\\nwas, so would I make my might and hands invincible, to be\\nhateful to many an one of those who do him despite and keep\\nhim from his honour.\"\\n\\n{* [Greek] seems to mean \\'upon the earth,\\' \\'above ground,\\'\\nas opposed to the dead who are below, rather than \\'bound to\\nthe soil,\\' in which sense most commentators take it.}\\n\\n\\'Even so he spake, but I answered him saying: \"As for noble\\nPeleus, verily I have heard nought of him; but concerning\\nthy dear son Neoptolemus, I will tell thee all the truth,\\naccording to thy word. It was I that led him up out of\\nScyros in my good hollow ship, in the wake of the\\ngoodly-greaved Achaeans. Now oft as we took counsel around\\nTroy town, he was ever the first to speak, and no word\\nmissed the mark; the godlike Nestor and I alone surpassed\\nhim. But whensoever we Achaeans did battle on the plain of\\nTroy, he never tarried behind in the throng or the press of\\nmen, but ran out far before us all, yielding to none in\\nthat might of his. And many men he slew in warfare dread;\\nbut I could not tell of all or name their names, even all\\nthe host he slew in succouring the Argives; but, ah, how he\\nsmote with the sword that son of Telephus, the hero\\nEurypylus, and many Ceteians {*} of his company were slain\\naround him, by reason of a woman\\'s bribe. He truly was the\\ncomeliest man that ever I saw, next to goodly Memnon. And\\nagain when we, the best of the Argives, were about to go\\ndown into the horse which Epeus wrought, and the charge of\\nall was laid on me, both to open the door of our good\\nambush and to shut the same, then did the other princes and\\ncounsellors of the Danaans wipe away the tears, and the\\nlimbs of each one trembled beneath him, but never once did\\nI see thy son\\'s fair face wax pale, nor did he wipe the\\ntears from his cheeks: but he besought me often to let him\\ngo forth from the horse, and kept handling his sword-hilt,\\nand his heavy bronze-shod spear, and he was set on mischief\\nagainst the Trojans. But after we had sacked the steep city\\nof Priam, he embarked unscathed with his share of the\\nspoil, and with a noble prize; he was not smitten with the\\nsharp spear, and got no wound in close fight: and many such\\nchances there be in war, for Ares rageth confusedly.\"\\n\\n{* See Lenormant, Premieres Civilisations, vol. i. p.289.}\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and the spirit of the son of Aeacus, fleet of\\nfoot, passed with great strides along the mead of asphodel,\\nrejoicing in that I had told him of his son\\'s renown.\\n\\n\\'But lo, other spirits of the dead that be departed stood\\nsorrowing, and each one asked of those that were dear to\\nthem. The soul of Aias, son of Telamon, alone stood apart\\nbeing still angry for the victory wherein I prevailed\\nagainst him, in the suit by the ships concerning the arms\\nof Achilles, that his lady mother had set for a prize; and\\nthe sons of the Trojans made award and Pallas Athene. Would\\nthat I had never prevailed and won such a prize! So goodly\\na head hath the earth closed over, for the sake of those\\narms, even over Aias, who in beauty and in feats of war was\\nof a mould above all the other Danaans, next to the noble\\nson of Peleus. To him then I spake softly, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Aias, son of noble Telamon, so art thou not even in death\\nto forget thy wrath against me, by reason of those arms\\naccursed, which the gods set to be the bane of the Argives?\\nWhat a tower of strength fell in thy fall, and we Achaeans\\ncease not to sorrow for thee, even as for the life of\\nAchilles, son of Peleus! Nay, there is none other to blame,\\nbut Zeus, who hath borne wondrous hate to the army of the\\nDanaan spearsmen, and laid on thee thy doom. Nay, come\\nhither, my lord, that thou mayest hear my word and my\\nspeech; master thy wrath and thy proud spirit.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, but he answered me not a word and passed to\\nErebus after the other spirits of the dead that be\\ndeparted. Even then, despite his anger, would he have\\nspoken to me or I to him, but my heart within me was minded\\nto see the spirits of those others that were departed.\\n\\n\\'There then I saw Minos, glorious son of Zeus, wielding a\\ngolden sceptre, giving sentence from his throne to the\\ndead, while they sat and stood around the prince, asking\\nhis dooms through the wide-gated house of Hades.\\n\\n\\'And after him I marked the mighty Orion driving the wild\\nbeasts together over the mead of asphodel, the very beasts\\nthat himself had slain on the lonely hills, with a strong\\nmace all of bronze in his hands, {*} that is ever unbroken.\\n\\n{* [Greek] in strict grammar agrees with [Greek] in 574,\\nbut this merely by attraction, for in sense it refers not\\nto the living man, but to his phantom.}\\n\\n\\'And I saw Tityos, son of renowned Earth, lying on a\\nlevelled ground, and he covered nine roods as he lay, and\\nvultures twain beset him one on either side, and gnawed at\\nhis liver, piercing even to the caul, but he drave them not\\naway with his hands. For he had dealt violently with Leto,\\nthe famous bedfellow of Zeus, as she went up to Pytho\\nthrough the fair lawns of Panopeus.\\n\\n\\'Moreover I beheld Tantalus in grievous torment, standing\\nin a mere and the water came nigh unto his chin. And he\\nstood straining as one athirst, but he might not attain to\\nthe water to drink of it. For often as that old man stooped\\ndown in his eagerness to drink, so often the water was\\nswallowed up and it vanished away, and the black earth\\nstill showed at his feet, for some god parched it evermore.\\nAnd tall trees flowering shed their fruit overhead, pears\\nand pomegranates and apple trees with bright fruit, and\\nsweet figs and olives in their bloom, whereat when that old\\nman reached out his hands to clutch them, the wind would\\ntoss them to the shadowy clouds.\\n\\n\\'Yea and I beheld Sisyphus in strong torment, grasping a\\nmonstrous stone with both his hands. He was pressing\\nthereat with hands and feet, and trying to roll the stone\\nupward toward the brow of the hill. But oft as he was about\\nto hurl it over the top, the weight would drive him back,\\nso once again to the plain rolled the stone, the shameless\\nthing. And he once more kept heaving and straining, and the\\nsweat the while was pouring down his limbs, and the dust\\nrose upwards from his head.\\n\\n\\'And after him I descried the mighty Heracles, his phantom,\\nI say; but as for himself he hath joy at the banquet among\\nthe deathless gods, and hath to wife Hebe of the fair\\nankles, child of great Zeus, and of Here of the golden\\nsandals. And all about him there was a clamour of the dead,\\nas it were fowls flying every way in fear, and he like\\nblack Night, with bow uncased, and shaft upon the string,\\nfiercely glancing around, like one in the act to shoot. And\\nabout his breast was an awful belt, a baldric of gold,\\nwhereon wondrous things were wrought, bears and wild boars\\nand lions with flashing eyes, and strife and battles and\\nslaughters and murders of men. Nay, now that he hath\\nfashioned this, never another may he fashion, whoso stored\\nin his craft the device of that belt! And anon he knew me\\nwhen his eyes beheld me, and making lament he spake unto me\\nwinged words:\\n\\n\\'\"Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many\\ndevices: ah! wretched one, dost thou too lead such a life\\nof evil doom, as I endured beneath the rays of the sun? I\\nwas the son of Zeus Cronion, yet had I trouble beyond\\nmeasure, for I was subdued unto a man far worse than I. And\\nhe enjoined on me hard adventures, yea and on a time he\\nsent me hither to bring back the hound of hell; for he\\ndevised no harder task for me than this. I lifted the hound\\nand brought him forth from out of the house of Hades; and\\nHermes sped me on my way and the grey-eyed Athene.\"\\n\\n\\'Therewith he departed again into the house of Hades, but I\\nabode there still, if perchance some one of the hero folk\\nbesides might come, who died in old time. Yea and I should\\nhave seen the men of old, whom I was fain to look on,\\nTheseus and Peirithous, renowned children of the gods. But\\nere that might be the myriad tribes of the dead thronged up\\ntogether with wondrous clamour: and pale fear gat hold of\\nme, lest the high goddess Persephone should send me the\\nhead of the Gorgon, that dread monster, from out of Hades.\\n\\n\\'Straightway then I went to the ship, and bade my men mount\\nthe vessel, and loose the hawsers. So speedily they went on\\nboard, and sat upon the benches. And the wave of the flood\\nbore the barque down the stream of Oceanus, we rowing\\nfirst, and afterwards the fair wind was our convoy.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XII\\n\\n  Odysseus, his passage by the Sirens, and by Scylla and\\n  Charybdis. The sacrilege committed by his men in the isle\\n  Thrinacia. The destruction of his ships and men. How he\\n  swam on a plank nine days together, and came to Ogygia,\\n  where he stayed seven years with Calypso.\\n\\n\\'Now after the ship had left the stream of the river\\nOceanus, and was come to the wave of the wide sea, and the\\nisle Aeaean, where is the dwelling place of early Dawn and\\nher dancing grounds, and the land of sunrising, upon our\\ncoming thither we beached the ship in the sand, and\\nourselves too stept ashore on the sea beach. There we fell\\non sound sleep and awaited the bright Dawn.\\n\\n\\'So soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, I\\nsent forth my fellows to the house of Circe to fetch the\\nbody of the dead Elpenor. And speedily we cut billets of\\nwood and sadly we buried him, where the furthest headland\\nruns out into the sea, shedding big tears. But when the\\ndead man was burned and the arms of the dead, we piled a\\nbarrow and dragged up thereon a pillar, and on the topmost\\nmound we set the shapen oar.\\n\\n\\'Now all that task we finished, and our coming from out of\\nHades was not unknown to Circe, but she arrayed herself and\\nspeedily drew nigh, and her handmaids with her bare flesh\\nand bread in plenty and dark red wine. And the fair goddess\\nstood in the midst and spake in our ears, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Men overbold, who have gone alive into the house of\\nHades, to know death twice, while all men else die once for\\nall. Nay come, eat ye meat and drink wine here all day\\nlong; and with the breaking of the day ye shall set sail,\\nand myself I will show you the path and declare each thing,\\nthat ye may not suffer pain or hurt through any grievous\\nill-contrivance by sea or on the land.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, and our lordly souls consented thereto. Thus\\nfor that time we sat the livelong day, until the going down\\nof the sun, feasting on abundant flesh and on sweet wine.\\nNow when the sun sank and darkness came on, my company laid\\nthem to rest by the hawsers of the ship. Then she took me\\nby the hand and led me apart from my dear company, and made\\nme to sit down and laid herself at my feet, and asked all\\nmy tale. And I told her all in order duly. Then at the last\\nthe Lady Circe spake unto me, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Even so, now all these things have an end; do thou then\\nhearken even as I tell thee, and the god himself shall\\nbring it back to thy mind. To the Sirens first shalt thou\\ncome, who bewitch all men, whosoever shall come to them.\\nWhoso draws nigh them unwittingly and hears the sound of\\nthe Sirens\\' voice, never doth he see wife or babes stand by\\nhim on his return, nor have they joy at his coming; but the\\nSirens enchant him with their clear song, sitting in the\\nmeadow, and all about is a great heap of bones of men,\\ncorrupt in death, and round the bones the skin is wasting.\\nBut do thou drive thy ship past, and knead honey-sweet wax,\\nand anoint therewith the ears of thy company, lest any of\\nthe rest hear the song; but if thou myself art minded to\\nhear, let them bind thee in the swift ship hand and foot,\\nupright in the mast-stead, and from the mast let rope-ends\\nbe tied, that with delight thou mayest hear the voice of\\nthe Sirens. And if thou shalt beseech thy company and bid\\nthem to loose thee, then let them bind thee with yet more\\nbonds. But when thy friends have driven thy ship past\\nthese, I will not tell thee fully which path shall\\nthenceforth be thine, but do thou thyself consider it, and\\nI will speak to thee of either way. On the one side there\\nare beetling rocks, and against them the great wave roars\\nof dark-eyed Amphitrite. These, ye must know, are they the\\nblessed gods call the Rocks Wandering. By this way even\\nwinged things may never pass, nay, not even the cowering\\ndoves that bear ambrosia to Father Zeus, but the sheer rock\\nevermore takes away one even of these, and the Father sends\\nin another to make up the tale. Thereby no ship of men ever\\nescapes that comes thither, but the planks of ships and the\\nbodies of men confusedly are tossed by the waves of the sea\\nand the storms of ruinous fire. One ship only of all that\\nfare by sea hath passed that way, even Argo, that is in all\\nmen\\'s minds, on her voyage from Aeetes. And even her the\\nwave would lightly have cast there upon the mighty rocks,\\nbut Here sent her by for love of Jason.\\n\\n\\'\"On the other part are two rocks, whereof the one reaches\\nwith sharp peak to the wide heaven, and a dark cloud\\nencompasses it; this never streams away, and there is no\\nclear air about the peak neither in summer nor in harvest\\ntide. No mortal man may scale it or set foot thereon, not\\nthough he had twenty hands and feet. For the rock is\\nsmooth, and sheer, as it were polished. And in the midst of\\nthe cliff is a dim cave turned to Erebus, towards the place\\nof darkness, whereby ye shall even steer your hollow ship,\\nnoble Odysseus. Not with an arrow from a bow might a man in\\nhis strength reach from his hollow ship into that deep\\ncave. And therein dwelleth Scylla, yelping terribly. Her\\nvoice indeed is no greater than the voice of a new-born\\nwhelp, but a dreadful monster is she, nor would any look on\\nher gladly, not if it were a god that met her. Verily she\\nhath twelve feet all dangling down; and six necks exceeding\\nlong, and on each a hideous head, and therein three rows of\\nteeth set thick and close, full of black death. Up to her\\nmiddle is she sunk far down in the hollow cave, but forth\\nshe holds her heads from the dreadful gulf, and there she\\nfishes, swooping round the rock, for dolphins or sea-dogs,\\nor whatso greater beast she may anywhere take, whereof the\\ndeep-voiced Amphitrite feeds countless flocks. Thereby no\\nsailors boast that they have fled scatheless ever with\\ntheir ship, for with each head she carries off a man, whom\\nshe hath snatched from out the dark-prowed ship.\\n\\n\\'\"But that other cliff, Odysseus, thou shalt note, lying\\nlower, hard by the first: thou couldest send an arrow\\nacross. And thereon is a great fig-tree growing, in fullest\\nleaf, and beneath it mighty Charybdis sucks down black\\nwater, for thrice a day she spouts it forth, and thrice a\\nday she sucks it down in terrible wise. Never mayest thou\\nbe there when she sucks the water, for none might save thee\\nthen from thy bane, not even the Earth-Shaker! But take\\nheed and swiftly drawing nigh to Scylla\\'s rock drive the\\nship past, since of a truth it is far better to mourn six\\nof thy company in the ship, than all in the selfsame hour.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, but I answered, and said unto her: \"Come I\\npray thee herein, goddess, tell me true, if there be any\\nmeans whereby I might escape from the deadly Charybdis and\\navenge me on that other, when she would prey upon my\\ncompany.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and that fair goddess answered me: \"Man\\noverbold, lo, now again the deeds of war are in thy mind\\nand the travail thereof. Wilt thou not yield thee even to\\nthe deathless gods? As for her, she is no mortal, but an\\nimmortal plague, dread, grievous, and fierce, and not to be\\nfought with; and against her there is no defence; flight is\\nthe bravest way. For if thou tarry to do on thine armour by\\nthe cliff, I fear lest once again she sally forth and catch\\nat thee with so many heads, and seize as many men as\\nbefore. So drive past with all thy force, and call on\\nCratais, mother of Scylla, which bore her for a bane to\\nmortals. And she will then let her from darting forth\\nthereafter.\\n\\n\\'\"Then thou shalt come unto the isle Thrinacia; there are\\nthe many kine of Helios and his brave flocks feeding, seven\\nherds of kine and as many goodly flocks of sheep, and fifty\\nin each flock. They have no part in birth or in corruption,\\nand there are goddesses to shepherd them, nymphs with fair\\ntresses, Phaethusa and Lampetie whom bright Neaera bare to\\nHelios Hyperion. Now when the lady their mother had borne\\nand nursed them, she carried them to the isle Thrinacia to\\ndwell afar, that they should guard their father\\'s flocks\\nand his kine with shambling gait. If thou doest these no\\nhurt, being heedful of thy return, truly ye may even yet\\nreach Ithaca, albeit in evil case. But if thou hurtest\\nthem, I foreshow ruin for thy ship and for thy men, and\\neven though thou shouldest thyself escape, late shalt thou\\nreturn in evil plight with the loss of all thy company.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, and anon came the golden-throned Dawn. Then\\nthe fair goddess took her way up the island. But I departed\\nto my ship and roused my men themselves to mount the vessel\\nand loose the hawsers. And speedily they went aboard and\\nsat upon the benches, and sitting orderly smote the grey\\nsea water with their oars. And in the wake of our\\ndark-prowed ship she sent a favouring wind that filled the\\nsails, a kindly escort,--even Circe of the braided tresses,\\na dread goddess of human speech. And straightway we set in\\norder the gear throughout the ship and sat us down, and the\\nwind and the helmsman guided our barque.\\n\\n\\'Then I spake among my company with a heavy heart:\\n\"Friends, forasmuch as it is not well that one or two alone\\nshould know of the oracles that Circe, the fair goddess,\\nspake unto me, therefore will I declare them, that with\\nforeknowledge we may die, or haply shunning death and\\ndestiny escape. First she bade us avoid the sound of the\\nvoice of the wondrous Sirens, and their field of flowers,\\nand me only she bade listen to their voices. So bind ye me\\nin a hard bond, that I may abide unmoved in my place,\\nupright in the mast-stead, and from the mast let rope-ends\\nbe tied, and if I beseech and bid you to set me free, then\\ndo ye straiten me with yet more bonds.\"\\n\\n\\'Thus I rehearsed these things one and all, and declared\\nthem to my company. Meanwhile our good ship quickly came to\\nthe island of the Sirens twain, for a gentle breeze sped\\nher on her way. Then straightway the wind ceased, and lo,\\nthere was a windless calm, and some god lulled the waves.\\nThen my company rose up and drew in the ship\\'s sails, and\\nstowed them in the hold of the ship, while they sat at the\\noars and whitened the water with their polished pine\\nblades. But I with my sharp sword cleft in pieces a great\\ncircle of wax, and with my strong hands kneaded it. And\\nsoon the wax grew warm, for that my great might constrained\\nit, and the beam of the lord Helios, son of Hyperion. And I\\nanointed therewith the ears of all my men in their order,\\nand in the ship they bound me hand and foot upright in the\\nmast-stead, and from the mast they fastened rope-ends and\\nthemselves sat down, and smote the grey sea water with\\ntheir oars. But when the ship was within the sound of a\\nman\\'s shout from the land, we fleeing swiftly on our way,\\nthe Sirens espied the swift ship speeding toward them, and\\nthey raised their clear-toned song:\\n\\n\\'\"Hither, come hither, renowned Odysseus, great glory of\\nthe Achaeans, here stay thy barque, that thou mayest listen\\nto the voice of us twain. For none hath ever driven by this\\nway in his black ship, till he hath heard from our lips the\\nvoice sweet as the honeycomb, and hath had joy thereof and\\ngone on his way the wiser. For lo, we know all things, all\\nthe travail that in wide Troy-land the Argives and Trojans\\nbare by the gods\\' designs, yea, and we know all that shall\\nhereafter be upon the fruitful earth.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake they uttering a sweet voice, and my heart was\\nfain to listen, and I bade my company unbind me, nodding at\\nthem with a frown, but they bent to their oars and rowed\\non. Then straight uprose Perimedes and Eurylochus and bound\\nme with more cords and straitened me yet the more.  Now\\nwhen we had driven past them, nor heard we any longer the\\nsound of the Sirens or their song, forthwith my dear\\ncompany took away the wax wherewith I had anointed their\\nears and loosed me from my bonds.\\n\\n\\'But so soon as we left that isle, thereafter presently I\\nsaw smoke and a great wave, and heard the sea roaring. Then\\nfor very fear the oars flew from their hands, and down the\\nstream they all splashed, and the ship was holden there,\\nfor my company no longer plied with their hands the\\ntapering oars. But I paced the ship and cheered on my men,\\nas I stood by each one and spake smooth words:\\n\\n\\'\"Friends, forasmuch as in sorrow we are not all unlearned,\\ntruly this is no greater woe that is upon us, {*} than when\\nthe Cyclops penned us by main might in his hollow cave; yet\\neven thence we made escape by my manfulness, even by my\\ncounsel and my wit, and some day I think that this\\nadventure too we shall remember. Come now, therefore, let\\nus all give ear to do according to my word. Do ye smite the\\ndeep surf of the sea with your oars, as ye sit on the\\nbenches, if peradventure Zeus may grant us to escape from\\nand shun this death. And as for thee, helmsman, thus I\\ncharge thee, and ponder it in thine heart seeing that thou\\nwieldest the helm of the hollow ship. Keep the ship well\\naway from this smoke and from the wave and hug the rocks,\\nlest the ship, ere thou art aware, start from her course to\\nthe other side, and so thou hurl us into ruin.\"\\n\\n{* Reading [Greek], not [Greek] with La Roche.}\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and quickly they hearkened to my words. But of\\nScylla I told them nothing more, a bane none might deal\\nwith, lest haply my company should cease from rowing for\\nfear, and hide them in the hold. In that same hour I\\nsuffered myself to forget the hard behest of Circe, in that\\nshe bade me in nowise be armed; but I did on my glorious\\nharness and caught up two long lances in my hands, and went\\non the decking of the prow, for thence methought that\\nScylla of the rock would first be seen, who was to bring\\nwoe on my company. Yet could I not spy her anywhere, and my\\neyes waxed weary for gazing all about toward the darkness\\nof the rock.\\n\\n\"Next we began to sail up the narrow strait lamenting. For\\non the one hand lay Scylla, and on the other mighty\\nCharybdis in terrible wise sucked down the salt sea water.\\nAs often as she belched it forth, like a cauldron on a\\ngreat fire she would seethe up through all her troubled\\ndeeps, and overhead the spray fell on the tops of either\\ncliff. But oft as she gulped down the salt sea water,\\nwithin she was all plain to see through her troubled deeps,\\nand the rock around roared horribly and beneath the earth\\nwas manifest swart with sand, and pale fear gat hold on my\\nmen. Toward her, then, we looked fearing destruction; but\\nScylla meanwhile caught from out my hollow ship six of my\\ncompany, the hardiest of their hands and the chief in\\nmight. And looking into the swift ship to find my men, even\\nthen I marked their feet and hands as they were lifted on\\nhigh, and they cried aloud in their agony, and called me by\\nmy name for that last time of all. Even as when as fisher\\non some headland lets down with a long rod his baits for a\\nsnare to the little fishes below, casting into the deep the\\nhorn of an ox of the homestead, and as he catches each\\nflings it writhing ashore, so writhing were they borne\\nupward to the cliff. And there she devoured them shrieking\\nin her gates, they stretching forth their hands to me in\\nthe dread death-struggle. And the most pitiful thing was\\nthis that mine eyes have seen of all my travail in\\nsearching out the paths of the sea.\\n\\n\\'Now when we had escaped the Rocks and dread Charybdis and\\nScylla, thereafter we soon came to the fair island of the\\ngod; where were the goodly kine, broad of brow, and the\\nmany brave flocks of Helios Hyperion. Then while as yet I\\nwas in my black ship upon the deep, I heard the lowing of\\nthe cattle being stalled and the bleating of the sheep, and\\non my mind there fell the saying of the blind seer, Theban\\nTeiresias, and of Circe of Aia, who charged me very\\nstraitly to shun the isle of Helios, the gladdener of the\\nworld. Then I spake out among my company in sorrow of\\nheart:\\n\\n\\'\"Hear my words, my men, albeit in evil plight, that I may\\ndeclare unto you the oracles of Teiresias and of Circe of\\nAia, who very straitly charged me to shun the isle of\\nHelios, the gladdener of the world. For there she said the\\nmost dreadful mischief would befal us. Nay, drive ye then\\nthe black ship beyond and past that isle.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and their heart was broken within them. And\\nEurylochus straightway answered me sadly, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Hardy art thou, Odysseus, of might beyond measure, and\\nthy limbs are never weary; verily thou art fashioned all of\\niron, that sufferest not thy fellows, foredone with toil\\nand drowsiness, to set foot on shore, where we might\\npresently prepare us a good supper in this sea-girt island.\\nBut even as we are thou biddest us fare blindly through the\\nsudden night, and from the isle go wandering on the misty\\ndeep. And strong winds, the bane of ships, are born of the\\nnight. How could a man escape from utter doom, if there\\nchanced to come a sudden blast of the South Wind, or of the\\nboisterous West, which mainly wreck ships, beyond the will\\nof the gods, the lords of all? Howbeit for this present let\\nus yield to the black night, and we will make ready our\\nsupper abiding by the swift ship, and in the morning we\\nwill climb on board, and put out into the broad deep.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake Eurylochus, and the rest of my company consented\\nthereto. Then at the last I knew that some god was indeed\\nimagining evil, and I uttered my voice and spake unto him\\nwinged words:\\n\\n\\'\"Eurylochus, verily ye put force upon me, being but one\\namong you all. But come, swear me now a mighty oath, one\\nand all, to the intent that if we light on a herd of kine\\nor a great flock of sheep, none in the evil folly of his\\nheart may slay any sheep or ox; but in quiet eat ye the\\nmeat which the deathless Circe gave.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and straightway they swore to refrain as I\\ncommanded them. Now after they had sworn and done that\\noath, we stayed our well-builded ship in the hollow harbour\\nnear to a well of sweet water, and my company went forth\\nfrom out the ship and deftly got ready supper. But when\\nthey had put from them the desire of meat and drink,\\nthereafter they fell a weeping as they thought upon their\\ndear companions whom Scylla had snatched from out the\\nhollow ship and so devoured. And deep sleep came upon them\\namid their weeping. And when it was the third watch of the\\nnight, and the stars had crossed the zenith, Zeus the\\ncloud-gatherer roused against them an angry wind with\\nwondrous tempest, and shrouded in clouds land and sea\\nalike, and from heaven sped down the night. Now when early\\nDawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, we beached the ship,\\nand dragged it up within a hollow cave, where were the fair\\ndancing grounds of the nymphs and the places of their\\nsession. Thereupon I ordered a gathering of my men and\\nspake in their midst, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Friends, forasmuch as there is yet meat and drink in the\\nswift ship, let us keep our hands off those kine, lest some\\nevil thing befal us. For these are the kine and the brave\\nflocks of a dread god, even of Helios, who overseeth all\\nand overheareth all things.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and their lordly spirit hearkened thereto.\\nThen for a whole month the South Wind blew without ceasing,\\nand no other wind arose, save only the East and the South.\\n\\n\\'Now so long as my company still had corn and red wine,\\nthey refrained them from the kine, for they were fain of\\nlife. But when the corn was now all spent from out the\\nship, and they went wandering with barbed hooks in quest of\\ngame, as needs they must, fishes and fowls, whatsoever\\nmight come to their hand, for hunger gnawed at their belly,\\nthen at last I departed up the isle, that I might pray to\\nthe gods, if perchance some one of them might show me a way\\nof returning. And now when I had avoided my company on my\\nway through the island, I laved my hands where was a\\nshelter from the wind, and prayed to all the gods that hold\\nOlympus. But they shed sweet sleep upon my eyelids. And\\nEurylochus the while set forth an evil counsel to my\\ncompany:\\n\\n\\'\"Hear my words, my friends, though ye be in evil case.\\nTruly every shape of death is hateful to wretched mortals,\\nbut to die of hunger and so meet doom is most pitiful of\\nall. Nay come, we will drive off the best of the kine of\\nHelios and will do sacrifice to the deathless gods who keep\\nwide heaven. And if we may yet reach Ithaca, our own\\ncountry, forthwith will we rear a rich shrine to Helios\\nHyperion, and therein would we set many a choice offering.\\nBut if he be somewhat wroth for his cattle with straight\\nhorns, and is fain to wreck our ship, and the other gods\\nfollow his desire, rather with one gulp at the wave would I\\ncast my life away, than be slowly straitened to death in a\\ndesert isle.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake Eurylochus, and the rest of the company consented\\nthereto. Forthwith they drave off the best of the kine of\\nHelios that were nigh at hand, for the fair kine of\\nshambling gait and broad of brow were feeding no great way\\nfrom the dark-prowed ship. Then they stood around the\\ncattle and prayed to the gods, plucking the fresh leaves\\nfrom an oak of lofty boughs, for they had no white barley\\non board the decked ship. Now after they had prayed and cut\\nthe throats of the kine and flayed them, they cut out\\nslices of the thighs and wrapped them in the fat, making a\\ndouble fold, and thereon they laid raw flesh. Yet had they\\nno pure wine to pour over the flaming sacrifices, but they\\nmade libation with water and roasted the entrails over the\\nfire. Now after the thighs were quite consumed and they had\\ntasted the inner parts, they cut the rest up small and\\nspitted it on spits. In the same hour deep sleep sped from\\nmy eyelids and I sallied forth to the swift ship and the\\nsea-banks. But on my way as I drew near to the curved ship,\\nthe sweet savour of the fat came all about me; and I\\ngroaned and spake out before the deathless gods:\\n\\n\\'\"Father Zeus, and all ye other blessed gods that live for\\never, verily to my undoing ye have lulled me with a\\nruthless sleep, and my company abiding behind have imagined\\na monstrous deed.\"\\n\\n\\'Then swiftly to Helios Hyperion came Lampetie of the long\\nrobes, with the tidings that we had slain his kine. And\\nstraight he spake with angry heart amid the Immortals:\\n\\n\\'\"Father Zeus, and all ye other blessed gods that live for\\never, take vengeance I pray you on the company of Odysseus,\\nson of Laertes, that have insolently slain my cattle,\\nwherein I was wont to be glad as I went toward the starry\\nheaven, and when I again turned earthward from the\\nfirmament. And if they pay me not full atonement for the\\ncattle, I will go down to Hades and shine among the dead.\"\\n\\n\\'And Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered him, saying: \"Helios,\\ndo thou, I say, shine on amidst the deathless gods, and\\namid mortal men upon the earth, the grain-giver. But as for\\nme, I will soon smite their swift ship with my white bolt,\\nand cleave it in pieces in the midst of the wine-dark\\ndeep.\"\\n\\n\\'This I heard from Calypso of the fair hair; and she said\\nthat she herself had heard it from Hermes the Messenger.\\n\\n\\'But when I had come down to the ship and to the sea, I\\nwent up to my companions and rebuked them one by one; but\\nwe could find no remedy, the cattle were dead and gone. And\\nsoon thereafter the gods showed forth signs and wonders to\\nmy company. The skins were creeping, and the flesh\\nbellowing upon the spits, both the roast and raw, and there\\nwas a sound as the voice of kine.\\n\\n\\'Then for six days my dear company feasted on the best of\\nthe kine of Helios which they had driven off. But when\\nZeus, son of Cronos, had added the seventh day thereto,\\nthereafter the wind ceased to blow with a rushing storm,\\nand at once we climbed the ship and launched into the broad\\ndeep, when we had set up the mast and hoisted the white\\nsails.\\n\\n\\'But now when we left that isle nor any other land\\nappeared, but sky and sea only, even then the son of Cronos\\nstayed a dark cloud above the hollow ship, and beneath it\\nthe deep darkened. And the ship ran on her way for no long\\nwhile, for of a sudden came the shrilling West, with the\\nrushing of a great tempest, and the blast of wind snapped\\nthe two forestays of the mast, and the mast fell backward\\nand all the gear dropped into the bilge. And behold, on the\\nhind part of the ship the mast struck the head of the pilot\\nand brake all the bones of his skull together, and like a\\ndiver he dropt down from the deck, and his brave spirit\\nleft his bones. In that same hour Zeus thundered and cast\\nhis bolt upon the ship, and she reeled all over being\\nstricken by the bolt of Zeus, and was filled with sulphur,\\nand lo, my company fell from out the vessel. Like sea-gulls\\nthey were borne round the black ship upon the billows, and\\nthe god reft them of returning.\\n\\n\\'But I kept pacing through my ship, till the surge loosened\\nthe sides from the keel, and the wave swept her along\\nstript of her tackling, and brake her mast clean off at the\\nkeel. Now the backstay fashioned of an oxhide had been\\nflung thereon; therewith I lashed together both keel and\\nmast, and sitting thereon I was borne by the ruinous winds.\\n\\n\\'Then verily the West Wind ceased to blow with a rushing\\nstorm, and swiftly withal the South Wind came, bringing\\nsorrow to my soul, that so I might again measure back that\\nspace of sea, the way to deadly Charybdis. All the night\\nwas I borne, but with the rising of the sun I came to the\\nrock of Scylla, and to dread Charybdis. Now she had sucked\\ndown her salt sea water, when I was swung up on high to the\\ntall fig-tree whereto I clung like a bat, and could find no\\nsure rest for my feet nor place to stand, for the roots\\nspread far below and the branches hung aloft out of reach,\\nlong and large, and overshadowed Charybdis. Steadfast I\\nclung till she should spew forth mast and keel again; and\\nlate they came to my desire. At the hour when a man rises\\nup from the assembly and goes to supper, one who judges the\\nmany quarrels of the young men that seek to him for law, at\\nthat same hour those timbers came forth to view from out\\nCharybdis. And I let myself drop down hands and feet, and\\nplunged heavily in the midst of the waters beyond the long\\ntimbers, and sitting on these I rowed hard with my hands.\\nBut the father of gods and of men suffered me no more to\\nbehold Scylla, else I should never have escaped from utter\\ndoom.\\n\\n\\'Thence for nine days was I borne, and on the tenth night\\nthe gods brought me nigh to the isle of Ogygia, where\\ndwells Calypso of the braided tresses, an awful goddess of\\nmortal speech, who took me in and entreated me kindly. But\\nwhy rehearse all this tale? For even yesterday I told it to\\nthee and to thy noble wife in thy house; and it liketh me\\nnot twice to tell a plain-told tale.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XIII\\n\\n  Odysseus, sleeping, is set ashore at Ithaca by the\\n  Phaeacians, and waking knows it not. Pallas, in the form of\\n  a shepherd, helps to hide his treasure. The ship that\\n  conveyed him is turned into a rock, and Odysseus by Pallas\\n  is instructed what to do, and transformed into an old\\n  beggarman.\\n\\nSo spake he, and dead silence fell on all, and they were\\nspell-bound throughout the shadowy halls. Thereupon\\nAlcinous answered him, and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Odysseus, now that thou hast come to my high house with\\nfloor of bronze, never, methinks, shalt thou be driven from\\nthy way ere thou returnest, though thou hast been sore\\nafflicted. And for each man among you, that in these halls\\nof mine drink evermore the dark wine of the elders, and\\nhearken to the minstrel, this is my word and command.\\nGarments for the stranger are already laid up in a polished\\ncoffer, with gold curiously wrought, and all other such\\ngifts as the counsellors of the Phaeacians bare hither.\\nCome now, let us each of us give him a great tripod and a\\ncauldron, and we in turn will gather goods among the people\\nand get us recompense; for it were hard that one man should\\ngive without repayment.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Alcinous, and the saying pleased them well. Then\\nthey went each one to his house to lay him down to rest;\\nbut so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,\\nthey hasted to the ship and bare the bronze, the joy of\\nmen. And the mighty king Alcinous himself went about the\\nship and diligently bestowed the gifts beneath the benches,\\nthat they might not hinder any of the crew in their rowing,\\nwhen they laboured at their oars. Then they betook them to\\nthe house of Alcinous and fell to feasting. And the mighty\\nking Alcinous sacrificed before them an ox to Zeus, the son\\nof Cronos, that dwells in the dark clouds, who is lord of\\nall. And when they had burnt the pieces of the thighs, they\\nshared the glorious feast and made merry, and among them\\nharped the divine minstrel Demodocus, whom the people\\nhonoured. But Odysseus would ever turn his head toward the\\nsplendour of the sun, as one fain to hasten his setting:\\nfor verily he was most eager to return. And as when a man\\nlongs for his supper, for whom all day long two dark oxen\\ndrag through the fallow field the jointed plough, yea and\\nwelcome to such an one the sunlight sinketh, that so he may\\nget him to supper, for his knees wax faint by the way, even\\nso welcome was the sinking of the sunlight to Odysseus.\\nThen straight he spake among the Phaeacians, masters of the\\noar, and to Alcinous in chief he made known his word,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'My lord Alcinous, most notable of all the people, pour ye\\nthe drink offering, and send me safe upon my way, and as\\nfor you, fare ye well. For now have I all that my heart\\ndesired, an escort and loving gifts. May the gods of heaven\\ngive me good fortune with them, and may I find my noble\\nwife in my home with my friends unharmed, while ye, for\\nyour part, abide here and make glad your wedded wives and\\nchildren; and may the gods vouchsafe all manner of good,\\nand may no evil come nigh the people!\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and they all consented thereto and bade send\\nthe stranger on his way, in that he had spoken aright. Then\\nthe mighty Alcinous spake to the henchman: \\'Pontonous, mix\\nthe bowl and serve out the wine to all in the hall, that we\\nmay pray to Father Zeus, and send the stranger on his way\\nto his own country.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and Pontonous mixed the honey-hearted wine,\\nand served it to all in turn. And they poured forth before\\nthe blessed gods that keep wide heaven, even there as they\\nsat. Then goodly Odysseus uprose, and placed in Arete\\'s\\nhand the two-handled cup, and uttering his voice spake to\\nher winged words:\\n\\n\\'Fare thee well, O queen, all the days of thy life, till\\nold age come and death, that visit all mankind. But I go\\nhomeward, and do thou in this thy house rejoice in thy\\nchildren and thy people and Alcinous the king.\\'\\n\\nTherewith goodly Odysseus stept over the threshold. And\\nwith him the mighty Alcinous sent forth a henchman to guide\\nhim to the swift ship and the sea-banks. And Arete sent in\\nthis train certain maidens of her household, one bearing a\\nfresh robe and a doublet, and another she joined to them to\\ncarry the strong coffer, and yet another bare bread and red\\nwine. Now when they had come down to the ship and to the\\nsea, straightway the good men of the escort took these\\nthings and laid them by in the hollow ship, even all the\\nmeat and drink. Then they strewed for Odysseus a rug and a\\nsheet of linen, on the decks of the hollow ship, in the\\nhinder part thereof, that he might sleep sound. Then he too\\nclimbed aboard and laid him down in silence, while they sat\\nupon the benches, every man in order, and unbound the\\nhawser from the pierced stone. So soon as they leant\\nbackwards and tossed the sea water with the oar blade, a\\ndeep sleep fell upon his eyelids, a sound sleep, very\\nsweet, and next akin to death. And even as on a plain a\\nyoke of four stallions comes springing all together beneath\\nthe lash, leaping high and speedily accomplishing the way,\\nso leaped the stern of that ship, and the dark wave of the\\nsounding sea rushed mightily in the wake, and she ran ever\\nsurely on her way, nor could a circling hawk keep pace with\\nher, of winged things the swiftest. Even thus she lightly\\nsped and cleft the waves of the sea, bearing a man whose\\ncounsel was as the counsel of the gods, one that erewhile\\nhad suffered much sorrow of heart, in passing through the\\nwars of men, and the grievous waves; but for that time he\\nslept in peace, forgetful of all that he had suffered.\\n\\nSo when the star came up, that is brightest of all, and\\ngoes ever heralding the light of early Dawn, even then did\\nthe seafaring ship draw nigh the island. There is in the\\nland of Ithaca a certain haven of Phorcys, the ancient one\\nof the sea, and thereby are two headlands of sheer cliff,\\nwhich slope to the sea on the haven\\'s side and break the\\nmighty wave that ill winds roll without, but within, the\\ndecked ships ride unmoored when once they have reached the\\nplace of anchorage. Now at the harbour\\'s head is a\\nlong-leaved olive tree, and hard by is a pleasant cave and\\nshadowy, sacred to the nymphs, that are called the Naiads.\\nAnd therein are mixing bowls and jars of stone, and there\\nmoreover do bees hive. And there are great looms of stone,\\nwhereon the nymphs weave raiment of purple stain, a marvel\\nto behold, and therein are waters welling evermore. Two\\ngates there are to the cave, the one set toward the North\\nWind whereby men may go down, but the portals toward the\\nSouth pertain rather to the gods, whereby men may not\\nenter: it is the way of the immortals.\\n\\nThither they, as having knowledge of that place, let drive\\ntheir ship; and now the vessel in full course ran ashore,\\nhalf her keel\\'s length high; so well was she sped by the\\nhands of the oarsmen. Then they alighted from the benched\\nship upon the land, and first they lifted Odysseus from out\\nthe hollow ship, all as he was in the sheet of linen and\\nthe bright rug, and laid him yet heavy with slumber on the\\nsand. And they took forth the goods which the lordly\\nPhaeacians had given him on his homeward way by grace of\\nthe great-hearted Athene. These they set in a heap by the\\ntrunk of the olive tree, a little aside from the road, lest\\nsome wayfaring man, before Odysseus awakened, should come\\nand spoil them. Then themselves departed homeward again.\\nBut the shaker of the earth forgat not the threats,\\nwherewith at the first he had threatened god like Odysseus,\\nand he inquired into the counsel of Zeus, saying:\\n\\n\\'Father Zeus, I for one shall no longer be of worship among\\nthe deathless gods, when mortal men hold me in no regard,\\neven Phaeacians, who moreover are of mine own lineage. Lo,\\nnow I said that after much affliction Odysseus should come\\nhome, for I had no mind to rob him utterly of his return,\\nwhen once thou hadst promised it and given assent; but\\nbehold, in his sleep they have borne him in a swift ship\\nover the sea, and set him down in Ithaca, and given him\\ngifts out of measure, bronze and gold in plenty and woven\\nraiment, much store, such as never would Odysseus have won\\nfor himself out of Troy; yea, though he had returned unhurt\\nwith the share of the spoil that fell to him.\\'\\n\\nAnd Zeus, the cloud gatherer, answered him saying: \\'Lo,\\nnow, shaker of the earth, of widest power, what a word hast\\nthou spoken! The gods nowise dishonour thee; hard would it\\nbe to assail with dishonour our eldest and our best. But if\\nany man, giving place to his own hardihood and strength,\\nholds thee not in worship, thou hast always thy revenge for\\nthe same, even in the time to come. Do thou as thou wilt,\\nand as seems thee good.\\'\\n\\nThen Poseidon, shaker of the earth, answered him:\\n\\'Straightway would I do even as thou sayest, O god of the\\ndark clouds; but thy wrath I always hold in awe and avoid.\\nHowbeit, now I fain would smite a fair ship of the\\nPhaeacians, as she comes home from a convoy on the misty\\ndeep, that thereby they may learn to hold their hands, and\\ncease from giving escort to men; and I would overshadow\\ntheir city with a great mountain.\\'\\n\\nAnd Zeus the gatherer of the clouds, answered him, saying:\\n\\'Friend, learn now what seems best in my sight. At an hour\\nwhen the folk are all looking forth from the city at the\\nship upon her way, smite her into a stone hard by the land;\\na stone in the likeness of a swift ship, that all mankind\\nmay marvel, and do thou overshadow their city with a great\\nmountain.\\'\\n\\nNow when Poseidon, shaker of the earth, heard this saying,\\nhe went on his way to Scheria, where the Phaeacians dwell.\\nThere he abode awhile; and lo, she drew near, the seafaring\\nship, lightly sped upon her way. Then nigh her came the\\nshaker of the earth, and he smote her into a stone, and\\nrooted her far below with the down-stroke of his hand; and\\nhe departed thence again.\\n\\nThen one to the other they spake winged words, the\\nPhaeacians of the long oars, mariners renowned. And thus\\nwould they speak, looking each man to his neighbour:\\n\\n\\'Ah me! who is this that fettered our swift ship on the\\ndeep as she drave homewards? Even now she stood full in\\nsight.\\'\\n\\nEven so they would speak; but they knew not how these\\nthings were ordained. And Alcinous made harangue and spake\\namong them:\\n\\n\\'Lo now, in very truth the ancient oracles of my father\\nhave come home to me. He was wont to say that Poseidon was\\njealous of us, for that we give safe escort to all men. He\\nsaid that the day would come when the god would smite a\\nfair ship of the Phaeacians, as she came home from a convoy\\non the misty deep, and overshadow our city with a great\\nmountain. Thus that ancient one would speak; and lo, all\\nthese things now have an end. But come, let us all give ear\\nand do according to my word. Cease ye from the convoy of\\nmortals, whensoever any shall come unto our town, and let\\nus sacrifice to Poseidon twelve choice bulls, if perchance\\nhe may take pity, neither overshadow our city with a great\\nmountain.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and they were dismayed and got ready the\\nbulls. Thus were they praying to the lord Poseidon, the\\nprinces and counsellors of the land of the Phaeacians, as\\nthey stood about the altar.\\n\\nEven then the goodly Odysseus awoke where he slept on his\\nnative land; nor knew he the same again, having now been\\nlong afar, for around him the goddess had shed a mist, even\\nPallas Athene, daughter of Zeus, to the end that she might\\nmake him undiscovered for that he was, and might expound to\\nhim all things, that so his wife should not know him\\nneither his townsmen and kinsfolk, ere the wooers had paid\\nfor all their transgressions. Wherefore each thing showed\\nstrange to the lord of the land, the long paths and the\\nsheltering havens and the steep rocks and the trees in\\ntheir bloom. So he started up, and stood and looked upon\\nhis native land, and then he made moan withal, and smote on\\nboth his thighs with the down-stroke of his hands, and\\nmaking lament, he spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Oh, woe is me, unto what mortals\\' land am I now come? Say,\\nare they froward, and wild, and unjust, or hospitable and\\nof a god-fearing mind? Whither do I bear all this treasure?\\nYea, where am I wandering myself? Oh that the treasure had\\nremained with the Phaeacians where it was, so had I come to\\nsome other of the mighty princes, who would have entreated\\nme kindly and sent me on my way. But now I know not where\\nto bestow these things, nor yet will I leave them here\\nbehind, lest haply other men make spoil of them. Ah then,\\nthey are not wholly wise or just, the princes and\\ncounsellors of the Phaeacians, who carried me to a strange\\nland. Verily they promised to bring me to clear-seen\\nIthaca, but they performed it not. May Zeus requite them,\\nthe god of suppliants, seeing that he watches over all men\\nand punishes the transgressor! But come, I will reckon up\\nthese goods and look to them, lest the men be gone, and\\nhave taken aught away upon their hollow ship.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he set to number the fair tripods and the\\ncauldrons and the gold and the goodly woven raiment; and of\\nall these he lacked not aught, but he bewailed him for his\\nown country, as he walked downcast by the shore of the\\nsounding sea, and made sore lament. Then Athene came nigh\\nhim in the guise of a young man, the herdsman of a flock, a\\nyoung man most delicate, such as are the sons of kings. And\\nshe had a well-wrought mantle that fell in two folds about\\nher shoulders, and beneath her smooth feet she had sandals\\nbound, and a javelin in her hands. And Odysseus rejoiced as\\nhe saw her, and came over against her, and uttering his\\nvoice spake to her winged words:\\n\\n\\'Friend, since thou art the first that I have chanced on in\\nthis land, hail to thee, and with no ill-will mayest thou\\nmeet me! Nay, save this my substance and save me too, for\\nto thee as to a god I make prayer, and to thy dear knees\\nhave I come. And herein tell me true, that I may surely\\nknow. What land, what people is this? what men dwell\\ntherein? Surely, methinks, it is some clear seen isle, or a\\nshore of the rich mainland that lies and leans upon the\\ndeep.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again:\\n\\'Thou art witless, stranger, or thou art come from afar, if\\nindeed thou askest of this land; nay, it is not so very\\nnameless but that many men know it, both all those who\\ndwell toward the dawning and the sun, and they that abide\\nover against the light toward the shadowy west. Verily it\\nis rough and not fit for the driving of horses, yet is it\\nnot a very sorry isle, though narrow withal. For herein is\\ncorn past telling, and herein too wine is found, and the\\nrain is on it evermore, and the fresh dew. And it is good\\nfor feeding goats and feeding kine; all manner of wood is\\nhere, and watering-places unfailing are herein. Wherefore,\\nstranger, the name of Ithaca hath reached even unto\\nTroy-land, which men say is far from this Achaean shore.\\'\\n\\nSo spake she, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad,\\nand had joy in his own country, according to the word of\\nPallas Athene, daughter of Zeus, lord of the aegis. And he\\nuttered his voice and spake unto her winged words; yet he\\ndid not speak the truth, but took back the word that was on\\nhis lips, for quick and crafty was his wit within his\\nbreast:\\n\\n\\'Of Ithaca have I heard tell, even in broad Crete, far over\\nthe seas; and now have I come hither myself with these my\\ngoods. And I left as much again to my children, when I\\nturned outlaw for the slaying of the dear son of Idomeneus,\\nOrsilochus, swift of foot, who in wide Crete was the\\nswiftest of all men that live by bread. Now he would have\\ndespoiled me of all that booty of Troy, for the which I had\\nendured pain of heart, in passing through the wars of men,\\nand the grievous waves of the sea, for this cause that I\\nwould not do a favour to his father, and make me his squire\\nin the land of the Trojans, but commanded other fellowship\\nof mine own. So I smote him with a bronze-shod spear as he\\ncame home from the field, lying in ambush for him by the\\nwayside, with one of my companions. And dark midnight held\\nthe heavens, and no man marked us, but privily I took his\\nlife away. Now after I had slain him with the sharp spear,\\nstraightway I went to a ship and besought the lordly\\nPhoenicians, and gave them spoil to their hearts\\' desire. I\\ncharged them to take me on board, and land me at Pylos or\\nat goodly Elis where the Epeans bear rule. Howbeit of a\\ntruth, the might of the wind drave them out of their\\ncourse, sore against their will, nor did they wilfully play\\nme false. Thence we were driven wandering, and came hither\\nby night. And with much ado we rowed onward into harbour,\\nnor took we any thought of supper, though we stood sore in\\nneed thereof, but even as we were we stept ashore and all\\nlay down. Then over me there came sweet slumber in my\\nweariness, but they took forth my goods from the hollow\\nship, and set them by me where I myself lay upon the sands.\\nThen they went on board, and departed for the fair-lying\\nland of Sidon; while as for me I was left stricken at\\nheart.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he and the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, smiled, and\\ncaressed him with her hand; and straightway she changed to\\nthe semblance of a woman, fair and tall, and skilled in\\nsplendid handiwork. And uttering her voice she spake unto\\nhim winged words:\\n\\n\\'Crafty must he be, and knavish, who would outdo thee in\\nall manner of guile, even if it were a god encountered\\nthee. Hardy man, subtle of wit, of guile insatiate, so thou\\nwast not even in thine own country to cease from thy\\nsleights and knavish words, which thou lovest from the\\nbottom of thine heart! But come, no more let us tell of\\nthese things, being both of us practised in deceits, for\\nthat thou art of all men far the first in counsel and in\\ndiscourse, and I in the company of all the gods win renown\\nfor my wit and wile. Yet thou knewest not me, Pallas\\nAthene, daughter of Zeus, who am always by thee and guard\\nthee in all adventures. Yea, and I made thee to be beloved\\nof all the Phaeacians. And now am I come hither to contrive\\na plot with thee and to hide away the goods, that by my\\ncounsel and design the noble Phaeacians gave thee on thy\\nhomeward way. And I would tell thee how great a measure of\\ntrouble thou art ordained to fulfil within thy well-builded\\nhouse. But do thou harden thy heart, for so it must be, and\\ntell none neither man nor woman of all the folk, that thou\\nhast indeed returned from wandering, but in silence endure\\nmuch sorrow, submitting thee to the despite of men.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: \\'Hard is\\nit, goddess, for a mortal man that meets thee to discern\\nthee, howsoever wise he be; for thou takest upon thee every\\nshape. But this I know well, that of old thou wast kindly\\nto me, so long as we sons of the Achaeans made war in Troy.\\nBut so soon as we had sacked the steep city of Priam and\\nhad gone on board our ships, and the god had scattered the\\nAchaeans, thereafter I have never beheld thee, daughter of\\nZeus, nor seen thee coming on board my ship, to ward off\\nsorrow from me--but I wandered evermore with a stricken\\nheart, till the gods delivered me from my evil case--even\\ntill the day when, within the fat land of the men of\\nPhaeacia, thou didst comfort me with thy words, and thyself\\ndidst lead me to their city. And now I beseech thee in thy\\nfather\\'s name to tell me: for I deem not that I am come to\\nclear-seen Ithaca, but I roam over some other land, and\\nmethinks that thou speakest thus to mock me and beguile my\\nmind. Tell me whether in very deed I am come to mine own\\ndear country.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: \\'Yea,\\nsuch a thought as this is ever in thy breast. Wherefore I\\nmay in no wise leave thee in thy grief, so courteous art\\nthou, so ready of wit and so prudent. Right gladly would\\nany other man on his return from wandering have hasted to\\nbehold his children and his wife in his halls; but thou\\nhast no will to learn or to hear aught, till thou hast\\nfurthermore made trial of thy wife, who sits as ever in her\\nhalls, and wearily for her the nights wane always and the\\ndays, in shedding of tears. But of this I never doubted,\\nbut ever knew it in my heart that thou wouldest come home\\nwith the loss of all thy company. Yet, I tell thee, I had\\nno mind to be at strife with Poseidon, my own father\\'s\\nbrother, who laid up wrath in his heart against thee, being\\nangered at the blinding of his dear son. But come, and I\\nwill show thee the place of the dwelling of Ithaca, that\\nthou mayst be assured. Lo, here is the haven of Phorcys,\\nthe ancient one of the sea, and here at the haven\\'s head is\\nthe olive tree with spreading leaves, and hard by it is the\\npleasant cave and shadowy, sacred to the nymphs that are\\ncalled the Naiads. Yonder, behold, is the roofed cavern,\\nwhere thou offeredst many an acceptable sacrifice of\\nhecatombs to the nymphs; and lo, this hill is Neriton, all\\nclothed in forest.\\'\\n\\nTherewith the goddess scattered the mist, and the land\\nappeared. Then the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad\\nrejoicing in his own land, and he kissed the earth, the\\ngrain-giver. And anon he prayed to the nymphs, and lifted\\nup his hands, saying:\\n\\n\\'Ye Naiad nymphs, daughters of Zeus, never did I think to\\nlook on you again, but now be ye greeted in my loving\\nprayers: yea, and gifts as aforetime I will give, if the\\ndaughter of Zeus, driver of the spoil, suffer me of her\\ngrace myself to live, and bring my dear son to manhood.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again: \\'Be\\nof good courage, and let not thy heart be careful about\\nthese things. But come, let us straightway set thy goods in\\nthe secret place of the wondrous cave, that there they may\\nabide for thee safe. And let us for ourselves advise us how\\nall may be for the very best.\\'\\n\\nTherewith the goddess plunged into the shadowy cave,\\nsearching out the chambers of the cavern. Meanwhile\\nOdysseus brought up his treasure, the gold and the\\nunyielding bronze and fair woven raiment, which the\\nPhaeacians gave him. And these things he laid by with care,\\nand Pallas Athene, daughter of Zeus, lord of the aegis, set\\na stone against the door of the cave. Then they twain sat\\ndown by the trunk of the sacred olive tree, and devised\\ndeath for the froward wooers. And the goddess, grey-eyed\\nAthene, spake first, saying:\\n\\n\\'Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many\\ndevices, advise thee how thou mayest stretch forth thine\\nhands upon the shameless wooers, who now these three years\\nlord it through thy halls, as they woo thy godlike wife and\\nproffer the gifts of wooing. And she, that is ever\\nbewailing her for thy return, gives hope to all and makes\\npromises to every man and sends them messages, but her mind\\nis set on other things.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered her, saying:\\n\\n\\'Lo now, in very truth I was like to have perished in my\\nhalls by the evil doom of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, hadst\\nnot thou, goddess, declared me each thing aright. Come\\nthen, weave some counsel whereby I may requite them; and\\nthyself stand by me, and put great boldness of spirit\\nwithin me, even as in the day when we loosed the shining\\ncoronal of Troy. If but thou wouldest stand by me with such\\neagerness, thou grey-eyed goddess, I would war even with\\nthree hundred men, with thee my lady and goddess, if thou\\nof thy grace didst succour me the while.\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: \\'Yea,\\nverily I will be near thee nor will I forget thee,\\nwhensoever we come to this toil: and methinks that certain\\nof the wooers that devour thy livelihood shall bespatter\\nthe boundless earth with blood and brains. But come, I will\\nmake thee such-like that no man shall know thee. Thy fair\\nskin I will wither on thy supple limbs, and make waste thy\\nyellow hair from off thy head, and wrap thee in a foul\\ngarment, such that one would shudder to see a man therein.\\nAnd I will dim thy two eyes, erewhile so fair, in such wise\\nthat thou mayest be unseemly in the sight of all the wooers\\nand of thy wife and son, whom thou didst leave in thy\\nhalls. And do thou thyself first of all go unto the\\nswineherd, who tends thy swine, loyal and at one with thee,\\nand loves thy son and constant Penelope. Him shalt thou\\nfind sitting by the swine, as they are feeding near the\\nrock of Corax and the spring Arethusa, and there they eat\\nabundance of acorns and drink the black water, things\\nwhereby swine grow fat and well-liking. There do thou abide\\nand sit by the swine, and find out all, till I have gone to\\nSparta, the land of fair women, to call Telemachus thy dear\\nson, Odysseus, who hath betaken himself to spacious\\nLacedaemon, to the house of Menelaus to seek tidings of\\nthee, whether haply thou are yet alive.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: \\'Nay,\\nwherefore then didst thou not tell him, seeing thou hast\\nknowledge of all? Was it, perchance, that he too may wander\\nin sorrow over the unharvested seas, and that others may\\nconsume his livelihood?\\'\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him: \\'Nay, let\\nhim not be heavy on thy heart. I myself was his guide, that\\nby going thither he might win a good report. Lo, he knows\\nno toil, but he sits in peace in the palace of the son of\\nAtreus, and has boundless store about him. Truly the young\\nmen with their black ship they lie in wait, and are eager\\nto slay him ere he come to his own country. But this,\\nmethinks, shall never be. Yea, sooner shall the earth close\\nover certain of the wooers that devour thy livelihood.\\'\\n\\nTherewith Athene touched him with her wand. His fair flesh\\nshe withered on his supple limbs, and made waste his yellow\\nhair from off his head, and over all his limbs she cast the\\nskin of an old man, and dimmed his two eyes, erewhile so\\nfair. And she changed his raiment to a vile wrap and a\\ndoublet, torn garments and filthy, stained with foul smoke.\\nAnd over all she clad him with the great bald hide of a\\nswift stag, and she gave him a staff and a mean tattered\\nscrip, and a cord therewith to hang it.\\n\\nAnd after they twain had taken this counsel together, they\\nparted; and she now went to goodly Lacedaemon to fetch the\\nson of Odysseus.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XIV\\n\\n  Odysseus, in the form of a beggar, goes to Eumaeus, the\\n  master of his swine, where he is well used and tells a\\n  feigned story, and informs himself of the behaviour of the\\n  wooers.\\n\\nBut Odysseus fared forth from the haven by the rough track,\\nup the wooded country and through the heights, where Athene\\nhad showed him that he should find the goodly swineherd,\\nwho cared most for his substance of all the thralls that\\ngoodly Odysseus had gotten.\\n\\nNow he found him sitting at the vestibule of the house,\\nwhere his courtyard was builded high, in a place with wide\\nprospect; a great court it was and a fair, with free range\\nround it. This the swineherd had builded by himself for the\\nswine of his lord who was afar, and his mistress and the\\nold man Laertes knew not of it. With stones from the quarry\\nhad he builded it, and coped it with a fence of white\\nthorn, and he had split an oak to the dark core, and\\nwithout he had driven stakes the whole length thereof on\\neither side, set thick and close; and within the courtyard\\nhe made twelve styes hard by one another to be beds for the\\nswine, and in each stye fifty grovelling swine were penned,\\nbrood swine; but the boars slept without. Now these were\\nfar fewer in number, the godlike wooers minishing them at\\ntheir feasts, for the swineherd ever sent in the best of\\nall the fatted hogs. And their tale was three hundred and\\nthree-score. And by them always slept four dogs, as fierce\\nas wild beasts, which the swineherd had bred, a master of\\nmen. Now he was fitting sandals to his feet, cutting a good\\nbrown oxhide, while the rest of his fellows, three in all,\\nwere abroad this way and that, with the droves of swine;\\nwhile the fourth he had sent to the city to take a boar to\\nthe proud wooers, as needs he must, that they might\\nsacrifice it and satisfy their soul with flesh.\\n\\nAnd of a sudden the baying dogs saw Odysseus, and they ran\\nat him yelping, but Odysseus in his wariness sat him down,\\nand let the staff fall from his hand. There by his own\\nhomestead would he have suffered foul hurt, but the\\nswineherd with quick feet hasted after them, and sped\\nthrough the outer door, and let the skin fall from his\\nhand. And the hounds he chid and drave them this way and\\nthat, with a shower of stones, and he spake unto his lord,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Old man, truly the dogs went nigh to be the death of thee\\nall of a sudden, so shouldest thou have brought shame on\\nme. Yea, and the gods have given me other pains and griefs\\nenough. Here I sit, mourning and sorrowing for my godlike\\nlord, and foster the fat swine for others to eat, while he\\ncraving, perchance, for food, wanders over some land and\\ncity of men of a strange speech, if haply he yet lives and\\nbeholds the sunlight. But come with me, let us to the inner\\nsteading, old man, that when thy heart is satisfied with\\nbread and wine, thou too mayest tell thy tale and declare\\nwhence thou art, and how many woes thou hast endured.\\'\\n\\nTherewith the goodly swineherd led him to the steading, and\\ntook him in and set him down, and strewed beneath him thick\\nbrushwood, and spread thereon the hide of a shaggy wild\\ngoat, wide and soft, which served himself for a mattress.\\nAnd Odysseus rejoiced that he had given him such welcome,\\nand spake and hailed him:\\n\\n\\'May Zeus, O stranger, and all the other deathless gods\\ngrant thee thy dearest wish, since thou hast received me\\nheartily!\\'\\n\\nThen, O swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou answer him, saying:\\n\\'Guest of mine, it were an impious thing for me to slight a\\nstranger, even if there came a meaner man than thou; for\\nfrom Zeus are all strangers and beggars; and a little gift\\nfrom such as we, is dear; for this is the way with thralls,\\nwho are ever in fear when young lords like ours bear rule\\nover them. For surely the gods have stayed the returning of\\nmy master, who would have loved me diligently, and given me\\nsomewhat of my own, a house and a parcel of ground, and a\\ncomely {*} wife, such as a kind lord gives to his man, who\\nhath laboured much for him and the work of whose hands God\\nhath likewise increased, even as he increaseth this work of\\nmine whereat I abide. Therefore would my lord have rewarded\\nme greatly, had he grown old at home. But he hath perished,\\nas I would that all the stock of Helen had perished\\nutterly, forasmuch as she hath caused the loosening of many\\na man\\'s knees. For he too departed to Ilios of the goodly\\nsteeds, to get atonement for Agamemnon, that so he might\\nwar with the Trojans.\\'\\n\\n{* Reading [Greek]}\\n\\nTherewith he quickly bound up his doublet with his girdle,\\nand went his way to the styes, where the tribes of the\\nswine were penned. Thence he took and brought forth two,\\nand sacrificed them both, and singed them and cut them\\nsmall, and spitted them. And when he had roasted all, he\\nbare and set it by Odysseus, all hot as it was upon the\\nspits, and he sprinkled thereupon white barley-meal. Then\\nin a bowl of ivywood he mixed the honey-sweet wine, and\\nhimself sat over against him and bade him fall to:\\n\\n\\'Eat now, stranger, such fare as thralls have to hand, even\\nflesh of sucking pigs; but the fatted hogs the wooers\\ndevour, for they know not the wrath of the gods nor any\\npity. Verily the blessed gods love not froward deeds, but\\nthey reverence justice and the righteous acts of men. Yet\\neven foes and men unfriendly, that land on a strange coast,\\nand Zeus grants them a prey, and they have laden their\\nships and depart for home; yea, even on their hearts falls\\nstrong fear of the wrath of the gods. But lo you, these men\\nknow somewhat,--for they have heard an utterance of a god\\n--, even the tidings of our lord\\'s evil end, seeing that\\nthey are not minded justly to woo, nor to go back to their\\nown, but at ease they devour our wealth with insolence, and\\nnow there is no sparing. For every day and every night that\\ncomes from Zeus, they make sacrifice not of one victim\\nonly, nor of two, and wine they draw and waste it\\nriotously. For surely his livelihood was great past\\ntelling, no lord in the dark mainland had so much, nor any\\nin Ithaca itself; nay, not twenty men together have wealth\\nso great, and I will tell thee the sum thereof. Twelve\\nherds of kine upon the mainland, as many flocks of sheep,\\nas many droves of swine, as many ranging herds of goats,\\nthat his own shepherds and strangers pasture. And ranging\\nherds of goats, eleven in all, graze here by the extremity\\nof the island with trusty men to watch them. And day by day\\neach man of these ever drives one of the flock to the\\nwooers, whichsoever seems the best of the fatted goats. But\\nas for me I guard and keep these swine and I choose out for\\nthem, as well as I may, the best of the swine and send it\\nhence.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, but Odysseus ceased not to eat flesh and drink\\nwine right eagerly and in silence, and the while was sowing\\nthe seeds of evil for the wooers. Now when he had well\\neaten and comforted his heart with food, then the herdsman\\nfilled him the bowl out of which he was wont himself to\\ndrink, and he gave it him brimming with wine, and he took\\nit and was glad at heart, and uttering his voice spake to\\nhim winged words:\\n\\n\\'My friend, who was it then that bought thee with his\\nwealth, a man so exceedingly rich and mighty as thou\\ndeclarest? Thou saidest that he perished to get atonement\\nfor Agamemnon; tell me, if perchance I may know him, being\\nsuch an one as thou sayest. For Zeus, methinks, and the\\nother deathless gods know whether I may bring tidings of\\nhaving seen him; for I have wandered far.\\'\\n\\nThen the swineherd, a master of men, answered him: \\'Old\\nman, no wanderer who may come hither and bring tidings of\\nhim can win the ear of his wife and his dear son; but\\nlightly do vagrants lie when they need entertainment, and\\ncare not to tell truth. Whosoever comes straying to the\\nland of Ithaca, goes to my mistress and speaks words of\\nguile. And she receives him kindly and lovingly and\\ninquires of all things, and the tears fall from her eyelids\\nfor weeping, as is meet for a woman when her lord hath died\\nafar. And quickly enough wouldst thou too, old man, forge a\\ntale, if any would but give thee a mantle and a doublet for\\nraiment. But as for him, dogs and swift fowls are like\\nalready to have torn his skin from the bones, and his\\nspirit hath left him. Or the fishes have eaten him in the\\ndeep, and there lie his bones swathed in sand-drift on the\\nshore. Yonder then hath he perished, but for his friends\\nnought is ordained but care, for all, but for me in chief.\\nFor never again shall I find a lord so gentle, how far\\nsoever I may go, not though again I attain unto the house\\nof my father and my mother, where at first I was born, and\\nthey nourished me themselves and with their own hands they\\nreared me. Nor henceforth it is not for these that I sorrow\\nso much, though I long to behold them with mine eyes in\\nmine own country, but desire comes over me for Odysseus who\\nis afar. His name, stranger, even though he is not here, it\\nshameth me to speak, for he loved me exceedingly, and cared\\nfor me at heart; nay, I call him \"worshipful,\" albeit he is\\nfar hence.\\'\\n\\nThen the steadfast goodly Odysseus spake to him again: \\'My\\nfriend, forasmuch as thou gainsayest utterly, and sayest\\nthat henceforth he will not come again, and thine heart is\\never slow to believe, therefore will I tell thee not\\nlightly but with an oath, that Odysseus shall return. And\\nlet me have the wages of good tidings as soon as ever he in\\nhis journeying shall come hither to his home. Then clothe\\nme in a mantle and a doublet, goodly raiment. But ere that,\\nalbeit I am sore in need I will not take aught, for hateful\\nto me even as the gates of hell, is that man, who under\\nstress of poverty speaks words of guile. Now be Zeus my\\nwitness before any god, and the hospitable board and the\\nhearth of noble Odysseus whereunto I am come, that all\\nthese things shall surely be accomplished even as I tell\\nthee. In this same year Odysseus shall come hither; as the\\nold moon wanes and the new is born shall he return to his\\nhome, and shall take vengeance on all who here dishonour\\nhis wife and noble son.\\'\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: \\'Old man,\\nit is not I then, that shall ever pay thee these wages of\\ngood tidings, nor henceforth shall Odysseus ever come to\\nhis home. Nay drink in peace, and let us turn our thoughts\\nto other matters, and bring not these to my remembrance,\\nfor surely my heart within me is sorrowful whenever any man\\nputs me in mind of my true lord. But as for thine oath, we\\nwill let it go by; yet, oh that Odysseus may come according\\nto my desire, and the desire of Penelope and of that old\\nman Laertes and godlike Telemachus! But now I make a\\ncomfortless lament for the boy begotten of Odysseus, even\\nfor Telemachus. When the gods had reared him like a young\\nsapling, and I thought that he would be no worse man among\\nmen than his dear father, glorious in form and face, some\\ngod or some man marred his good wits within him, and he\\nwent to fair Pylos after tidings of his sire. And now the\\nlordly wooers lie in wait for him on his way home, that the\\nrace of godlike Arceisius may perish nameless out of\\nIthaca. Howbeit, no more of him now, whether he shall be\\ntaken or whether he shall escape, and Cronion stretch out\\nhis hand to shield him. But come, old man, do thou tell me\\nof thine own troubles. And herein tell me true, that I may\\nsurely know. Who art thou of the sons of men, and whence?\\nWhere is thy city, where are they that begat thee? Say on\\nwhat manner of ship didst thou come, and how did sailors\\nbring thee to Ithaca, and who did they avow them to be? For\\nin nowise do I deem that thou camest hither by land.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: \\'Yea\\nnow, I will tell thee all most plainly. Might we have food\\nand sweet wine enough to last for long, while we abide\\nwithin thy hut to feast thereon in quiet, and others betake\\nthem to their work; then could I easily speak for a whole\\nyear, nor yet make a full end of telling all the troubles\\nof my spirit, all the travail I have wrought by the will of\\nthe gods.\\n\\n\\'I avow that I come by lineage from wide Crete, and am the\\nson of a wealthy man. And many other sons he had born and\\nbred in the halls, lawful born of a wedded wife; but the\\nmother that bare me was a concubine bought with a price.\\nYet Castor son of Hylax, of whose blood I avow me to be,\\ngave me no less honour than his lawful sons. Now he at the\\ntime got worship even as a god from the Cretans in the\\nland, for wealth and riches and sons renowned. Howbeit the\\nfates of death bare him away to the house of Hades, and his\\ngallant sons divided among them his living and cast lots\\nfor it. But to me they gave a very small gift and assigned\\nme a dwelling, and I took unto me a wife, the daughter of\\nmen that had wide lands, by reason of my valour, for that I\\nwas no weakling nor a dastard; but now all my might has\\nfailed me, yet even so I deem that thou mightest guess from\\nseeing the stubble what the grain has been, for of trouble\\nI have plenty and to spare. But then verily did Ares and\\nAthene give me boldness and courage to hurl through the\\npress of men, whensoever I chose the best warriors for an\\nambush, sowing the seeds of evil for my foes; no boding of\\ndeath was ever in my lordly heart, but I would leap out the\\nforemost and slay with the spear whoso of my foes was less\\nfleet of foot than I. Such an one was I in war, but the\\nlabour of the field I never loved, nor home-keeping thrift,\\nthat breeds brave children, but galleys with their oars\\nwere dear to me, and wars and polished shafts and darts--\\nbaneful things whereat others use to shudder. But that,\\nmethinks, was dear to me which the god put in my heart, for\\ndivers men take delight in divers deeds. For ere ever the\\nsons of the Achaeans had set foot on the land of Troy, I\\nhad nine times been a leader of men and of swift-faring\\nships against a strange people, and wealth fell ever to my\\nhands. Of the booty I would choose out for me all that I\\ncraved, and much thereafter I won by lot. So my house got\\nincrease speedily, and thus I waxed dread and honourable\\namong the Cretans. But when Zeus, of the far-borne voice,\\ndevised at the last that hateful path which loosened the\\nknees of many a man in death, then the people called on me\\nand on renowned Idomeneus to lead the ships to Ilios, nor\\nwas there any way whereby to refuse, for the people\\'s voice\\nbore hard upon us. There we sons of the Achaeans warred for\\nnine whole years, and then in the tenth year we sacked the\\ncity of Priam, and departed homeward with our ships, and a\\ngod scattered the Achaeans. But Zeus, the counsellor,\\ndevised mischief against me, wretched man that I was! For\\none month only I abode and had joy in my children and my\\nwedded wife, and all that I had; and thereafter my spirit\\nbade me fit out ships in the best manner and sail to Egypt\\nwith my godlike company. Nine ships I fitted out and the\\nhost was gathered quickly; and then for six days my dear\\ncompany feasted, and I gave them many victims that they\\nmight sacrifice to the gods and prepare a feast for\\nthemselves. But on the seventh day we set sail from wide\\nCrete, with a North Wind fresh and fair, and lightly we ran\\nas it were down stream, yea and no harm came to any ship of\\nmine, but we sat safe and hale, while the wind and the\\npilots guided the barques. And on the fifth day we came to\\nthe fair-flowing Aegyptus, and in the river Aegyptus I\\nstayed my curved ships. Then verily I bade my dear\\ncompanions to abide there by the ships and to guard them,\\nand I sent forth scouts to range the points of outlook. But\\nmy men gave place to wantonness, being the fools of their\\nown force, and soon they fell to wasting the fields of the\\nEgyptians, exceeding fair, and led away their wives and\\ninfant children and slew the men. And the cry came quickly\\nto the city, and the people hearing the shout came forth at\\nthe breaking of the day, and all the plain was filled with\\nfootmen and chariots and with the glitter of bronze. And\\nZeus, whose joy is in the thunder, sent an evil panic upon\\nmy company, and none durst stand and face the foe, for\\ndanger encompassed us on every side. There they slew many\\nof us with the edge of the sword, and others they led up\\nwith them alive to work for them perforce. But as for me,\\nZeus himself put a thought into my heart; would to God that\\nI had rather died, and met my fate there in Egypt, for\\nsorrow was still mine host! Straightway I put off my\\nwell-wrought helmet from my head, and the shield from off\\nmy shoulders, and I cast away my spear from my hand, and I\\ncame over against the chariots of the king, and clasped and\\nkissed his knees, and he saved me and delivered me, and\\nsetting me on his own chariot took me weeping to his home.\\nTruly many an one made at me with their ashen spears, eager\\nto slay me, for verily they were sore angered. But the king\\nkept them off and had respect unto the wrath of Zeus, the\\ngod of strangers, who chiefly hath displeasure at evil\\ndeeds. So for seven whole years I abode with their king,\\nand gathered much substance among the Egyptians, for they\\nall gave me gifts. But when the eighth year came in due\\nseason, there arrived a Phoenician practised in deceit, a\\ngreedy knave, who had already done much mischief among men.\\nHe wrought on me with his cunning, and took me with him\\nuntil he came to Phoenicia, where was his house and where\\nhis treasures lay. There I abode with him for the space of\\na full year. But when now the months and days were\\nfulfilled, as the year came round and the seasons returned,\\nhe set me aboard a seafaring ship for Libya, under colour\\nas though I was to convey a cargo thither with him, but his\\npurpose was to sell me in Libya, and get a great price. So\\nI went with him on board, perforce, yet boding evil. And\\nthe ship ran before a North Wind fresh and fair, through\\nthe mid sea over above Crete, and Zeus contrived the\\ndestruction of the crew. But when we left Crete, and no\\nland showed in sight but sky and sea only, even then the\\nson of Cronos stayed a dark cloud over the hollow ship, and\\nthe deep grew dark beneath it. And in the same moment Zeus\\nthundered and smote his bolt into the ship, and she reeled\\nall over being stricken by the bolt of Zeus, and was filled\\nwith fire and brimstone, and all the crew fell overboard.\\nAnd like sea-gulls they were borne hither and thither on\\nthe waves about the black ship, and the god cut off their\\nreturn. But in this hour of my affliction Zeus himself put\\ninto my hands the huge mast of the dark-prowed ship, that\\neven yet I might escape from harm. So I clung round the\\nmast and was borne by the ruinous winds. For nine days was\\nI borne, and on the tenth black night the great rolling\\nwave brought me nigh to the land of the Thesprotians. There\\nthe king of the Thesprotians, the lord Pheidon, took me in\\nfreely, for his dear son lighted on me and raised me by the\\nhand and led me to his house, foredone with toil and the\\nkeen air, till he came to his father\\'s palace. And he\\nclothed me in a mantle and a doublet for raiment.\\n\\n\\'There I heard tidings of Odysseus, for the king told me\\nthat he had entertained him, and kindly entreated him on\\nhis way to his own country; and he showed me all the wealth\\nthat Odysseus had gathered, bronze and gold and\\nwell-wrought iron; yea it would suffice for his children\\nafter him even to the tenth generation, so great were the\\ntreasures he had stored in the chambers of the king. He had\\ngone, he said, to Dodona to hear the counsel of Zeus, from\\nthe high leafy oak tree of the god, how he should return to\\nthe fat land of Ithaca after long absence, whether openly\\nor by stealth. Moreover, he sware, in mine own presence, as\\nhe poured the drink offering in his house, that the ship\\nwas drawn down to the sea and his company were ready, who\\nwere to convey him to his own dear country. But ere that,\\nhe sent me off, for it chanced that a ship of the\\nThesprotians was starting for Dulichium, a land rich in\\ngrain. Thither he bade them bring me with all diligence to\\nthe king Acastus. But an evil counsel concerning me found\\nfavour in their sight, that even yet I might reach the\\nextremity of sorrow. When the seafaring ship had sailed a\\ngreat way from the land, anon they sought how they might\\ncompass for me the day of slavery. They stript me of my\\ngarments, my mantle and a doublet, and changed my raiment\\nto a vile wrap and doublet, tattered garments, even those\\nthou seest now before thee; and in the evening they reached\\nthe fields of clear-seen Ithaca. There in the decked ship\\nthey bound me closely with a twisted rope, and themselves\\nwent ashore, and hasted to take supper by the sea-banks.\\nMeanwhile the gods themselves lightly unclasped my bands,\\nand muffling my head with the wrap I slid down the smooth\\nlading-plank, and set my breast to the sea and rowed hard\\nwith both hands as I swam, and very soon I was out of the\\nwater and beyond their reach. Then I went up where there\\nwas a thicket, a wood in full leaf, and lay there\\ncrouching. And they went hither and thither making great\\nmoan; but when now it seemed to them little avail to go\\nfurther on their quest, they departed back again aboard\\ntheir hollow ship. And the gods themselves hid me easily\\nand brought me nigh to the homestead of a wise man; for\\nstill, methinks, I am ordained to live on.\\'\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer to him, swineherd Eumaeus: \\'Ah!\\nwretched guest, verily thou hast stirred my heart with the\\ntale of all these things, of thy sufferings and thy\\nwanderings. Yet herein, methinks, thou speakest not aright,\\nand never shalt thou persuade me with the tale about\\nOdysseus; why should one in thy plight lie vainly? Well I\\nknow of mine own self, as touching my lord\\'s return, that\\nhe was utterly hated by all the gods, in that they smote\\nhim not among the Trojans nor in the arms of his friends,\\nwhen he had wound up the clew of war. So should the whole\\nAchaean host have builded him a barrow; yea and for his son\\nwould he have won great glory in the after days; but now\\nall ingloriously the spirits of the storm have snatched him\\naway. But as for me I dwell apart by the swine and go not\\nto the city, unless perchance wise Penelope summons me\\nthither, when tidings of my master are brought I know not\\nwhence. Now all the people sit round and straitly question\\nthe news-bearer, both such as grieve for their lord that is\\nlong gone, and such as rejoice in devouring his living\\nwithout atonement. But I have no care to ask or to inquire,\\nsince the day that an Aetolian cheated me with his story,\\none who had slain his man and wandered over wide lands and\\ncame to my steading, and I dealt lovingly with him. He said\\nthat he had seen my master among the Cretans at the house\\nof Idomeneus, mending his ships which the storms had\\nbroken. And he said that he would come home either by the\\nsummer or the harvest-tide, bringing much wealth with the\\ngodlike men of his company. And thou too, old man of many\\nsorrows, seeing that some god hath brought thee to me, seek\\nnot my grace with lies, nor give me any such comfort; not\\nfor this will I have respect to thee or hold thee dear, but\\nonly for the fear of Zeus, the god of strangers, and for\\npity of thyself.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: \\'Verily\\nthy heart within thee is slow to believe, seeing that even\\nwith an oath I have not won thee, nor find credence with\\nthee. But come now, let us make a covenant; and we will\\neach one have for witnesses the gods above, who hold\\nOlympus. If thy lord shall return to this house, put on me\\na mantle and doublet for raiment, and send me on my way to\\nDulichium, whither I had a desire to go. But if thy lord\\nreturn not according to my word, set thy thralls upon me,\\nand cast me down from a mighty rock, that another beggar in\\nhis turn may beware of deceiving.\\'\\n\\nAnd the goodly swineherd answered him, saying: \\'Yea\\nstranger, even so should I get much honour and good luck\\namong men both now and ever hereafter, if after bringing\\nthee to my hut and giving thee a stranger\\'s cheer, I should\\nturn again and slay thee and take away thy dear life. Eager\\nindeed thereafter should I be to make a prayer to Zeus the\\nson of Cronos! But now it is supper-time, and would that my\\nfellows may speedily be at home, that we may make ready a\\ndainty supper within the hut.\\'\\n\\nThus they spake one to the other. And lo, the swine and the\\nswineherds drew nigh. And the swine they shut up to sleep\\nin their lairs, and a mighty din arose as the swine were\\nbeing stalled. Then the goodly swineherd called to his\\nfellows, saying:\\n\\n\\'Bring the best of the swine, that I may sacrifice it for a\\nguest of mine from a far land: and we too will have good\\ncheer therewith, for we have long suffered and toiled by\\nreason of the white-tusked swine, while others devour the\\nfruit of our labour without atonement.\\'\\n\\nTherewithal he cleft logs with the pitiless axe, and the\\nothers brought in a well-fatted boar of five years old; and\\nthey set him by the hearth nor did the swineherd forget the\\ndeathless gods, for he was of an understanding heart. But\\nfor a beginning of sacrifice he cast bristles from the head\\nof the white-tusked boar upon the fire, and prayed to all\\nthe gods that wise Odysseus might return to his own house.\\nThen he stood erect, and smote the boar with a billet of\\noak which he had left in the cleaving, and the boar yielded\\nup his life. Then they cut the throat and singed the\\ncarcass and quickly cut it up, and the swineherd took a\\nfirst portion from all the limbs, and laid the raw flesh on\\nthe rich fat. And some pieces he cast into the fire after\\nsprinkling them with bruised barley-meal, and they cut the\\nrest up small, and pierced it, and spitted and roasted it\\ncarefully, and drew it all off from the spits, and put the\\nwhole mess together on trenchers. Then the swineherd stood\\nup to carve, for well he knew what was fair, and he cut up\\nthe whole and divided it into seven portions. One, when he\\nhad prayed, he set aside for the nymphs and for Hermes son\\nof Maia, and the rest he distributed to each. And he gave\\nOdysseus the portion of honour, the long back of the\\nwhite-tusked boar, and the soul of his lord rejoiced at\\nthis renown, and Odysseus of many counsels hailed him\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Eumaeus, oh that thou mayest so surely be dear to father\\nZeus, as thou art to me, seeing that thou honourest me with\\na good portion, such an one as I am!\\'\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus:\\n\\n\\'Eat, luckless stranger, and make merry with such fare as\\nis here. And one thing the god will give and another\\nwithhold, even as he will, for with him all things are\\npossible.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and made burnt offering of the hallowed parts\\nto the everlasting gods, and poured the dark wine for a\\ndrink offering, and set the cup in the hands of Odysseus,\\nthe waster of cities, and sat down by his own mess. And\\nMesaulius bare them wheaten bread, a thrall that the\\nswineherd had gotten all alone, while his lord was away,\\nwithout the knowledge of his mistress and the old Laertes:\\nyea he had bought him of the Taphians with his own\\nsubstance. So they stretched forth their hands upon the\\ngood cheer spread before them. Now after they had put from\\nthem the desire of meat and drink, Mesaulius cleared away\\nthe bread, and they, now that they had eaten enough of\\nbread and flesh, were moved to go to rest.\\n\\nNow it was so that night came on foul with a blind moon,\\nand Zeus rained the whole night through, and still the\\ngreat West Wind, the rainy wind, was blowing. Then Odysseus\\nspake among them that he might make trial of the swineherd,\\nand see whether he would take off his own mantle and give\\nit to him or bid one of his company strip, since he cared\\nfor him so greatly:\\n\\n\\'Listen now, Eumaeus, and all of you his companions, with a\\nprayer will I utter my word; so bids me witless wine, which\\ndrives even the wisest to sing and to laugh softly, and\\nrouses him to dance, yea and makes him to speak out a word\\nwhich were better unspoken. Howbeit, now that I have broken\\ninto speech, I will not hide aught. Oh that I were young,\\nand my might were steadfast, as in the day when we arrayed\\nour ambush and led it beneath Troy town! And Odysseus, and\\nMenelaus son of Atreus, were leaders and with them I was a\\nthird in command; for so they bade me. Now when we had come\\nto the city and the steep wall, we lay about the citadel in\\nthe thick brushwood, crouching under our arms among the\\nreeds and the marsh land, and behold, the night came on\\nfoul, with frost, as the North Wind went down, while the\\nsnow fell from above, and crusted like rime, bitter cold,\\nand the ice set thick about our shields. Now the others all\\nhad mantles and doublets, and slept in peace with their\\nshields buckled close about their shoulders; but I as I\\nwent forth had left my mantle behind with my men, in my\\nfolly, thinking that even so I should not be cold: so I\\ncame with only my shield and bright leathern apron. But\\nwhen it was now the third watch of the night and the stars\\nhad passed the zenith, in that hour I spake unto Odysseus\\nwho was nigh me, and thrust him with my elbow, and he\\nlistened straightway:\\n\\n\\'\"Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many\\ndevices, verily I shall cease from among living men, for\\nthis wintry cold is slaying me, seeing that I have no\\nmantle. Some god beguiled me to wear a doublet only, and\\nhenceforth is no way of escape.\"\\n\\n\\'So I spake, and he apprehended a thought in his heart,\\nsuch an one as he was in counsel and in fight. So he\\nwhispered and spake to me, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Be silent now, lest some other Achaeans hear thee.\"\\nTherewith he raised his head upon his elbow, and spake,\\nsaying: \"Listen, friends, a vision from a god came to me in\\nmy sleep. Lo, we have come very far from the ships; I would\\nthere were one to tell it to Agamemnon, son of Atreus,\\nshepherd of the host, if perchance he may send us hither a\\ngreater company from the ships.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake he, and Thoas, son of Andraemon, rose up quickly\\nand cast off his purple mantle. And he started to run unto\\nthe ships, but I lay gladly in his garment, and the\\ngolden-throned Dawn showed her light. Oh! that I were young\\nas then and my might steadfast! Then should some of the\\nswineherds in the homestead give me a mantle, alike for\\nlove\\'s sake and for pity of a good warrior. But now they\\nscorn me for that sorry raiment is about my body.\\'\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer, O swineherd Eumaeus: \\'Old man,\\nthe tale that thou hast told in his praise is very good,\\nand so far thou hast not misspoken aught, nor uttered a\\nword unprofitably. Wherefore for this night thou shalt lack\\nneither raiment nor aught else that is the due of a hapless\\nsuppliant, when he has met them that can befriend him. But\\nin the morning thou shalt go shuffling in thine own rags,\\nfor there are not many mantles here or changes of doublet;\\nfor each man hath but one coat. But when the dear son of\\nOdysseus comes, he himself will give thee a mantle and\\ndoublet for raiment, and send thee whithersoever thy heart\\nand spirit bid.\\'\\n\\nWith that he sprang up and set a bed for Odysseus near the\\nfire, and thereon he cast skins of sheep and goats. There\\nOdysseus laid him down and Eumaeus cast a great thick\\nmantle over him, which he had ever by him for a change of\\ncovering, when any terrible storm should arise.\\n\\nSo there Odysseus slept, and the young men slept beside\\nhim. But the swineherd had no mind to lie there in a bed\\naway from the boars. So he made him ready to go forth and\\nOdysseus was glad, because he had a great care for his\\nmaster\\'s substance while he was afar. First he cast his\\nsharp sword about his strong shoulders, then he clad him in\\na very thick mantle, to keep the wind away; and he caught\\nup the fleece of a great and well-fed goat, and seized his\\nsharp javelin, to defend him against dogs and men. Then he\\nwent to lay him down even where the white-tusked boars were\\nsleeping, beneath the hollow of the rock, in a place of\\nshelter from the North Wind.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XV\\n\\n  Pallas sends home Telemachus from Lacedaemon with the\\n  presents given him by Menelaus. Telemachus landed, goes\\n  first to Eumaeus.\\n\\nNow Pallas Athene went to the wide land of Lacedaemon, to\\nput the noble son of the great-hearted Odysseus in mind of\\nhis return, and to make him hasten his coming. And she\\nfound Telemachus, and the glorious son of Nestor, couched\\nat the vestibule of the house of famous Menelaus. The son\\nof Nestor truly was overcome with soft sleep, but sweet\\nsleep gat not hold of Telemachus, but, through the night\\ndivine, careful thoughts for his father kept him wakeful.\\nAnd grey-eyed Athene stood nigh him and spake to him,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, it is no longer meet that thou shouldest\\nwander far from thy home, leaving thy substance behind\\nthee, and men in thy house so wanton, lest they divide and\\nutterly devour all thy wealth, and thou shalt have gone on\\na vain journey. But come, rouse with all haste Menelaus, of\\nthe loud war-cry, to send thee on thy way, that thou mayest\\neven yet find thy noble mother in her home. For even now\\nher father and her brethren bid her wed Eurymachus, for he\\noutdoes all the wooers in his presents, and hath been\\ngreatly increasing his gifts of wooing. So shall she take\\nno treasure from thy house despite thy will. Thou knowest\\nof what sort is the heart of a woman within her; all her\\ndesire is to increase the house of the man who takes her to\\nwife, but of her former children and of her own dear lord\\nshe has no more memory once he is dead, and she asks\\nconcerning him no more. Go then, and thyself place all thy\\nsubstance in the care of the handmaid who seems to thee the\\nbest, till the day when the gods shall show thee a glorious\\nbride. Now another word will I tell thee, and do thou lay\\nit up in thine heart. The noblest of the wooers lie in wait\\nfor thee of purpose, in the strait between Ithaca and\\nrugged Samos, eager to slay thee before thou come to thine\\nown country. But this, methinks, will never be; yea, sooner\\nshall the earth close over certain of the wooers that\\ndevour thy livelihood. Nay, keep thy well-wrought ship far\\nfrom those isles, and sail by night as well as day, and he\\nof the immortals who hath thee in his keeping and\\nprotection will send thee a fair breeze in thy wake. But\\nwhen thou hast touched the nearest shore of Ithaca, send\\nthy ship and all thy company forward to the city, but for\\nthy part seek first the swineherd who keeps thy swine,\\nloyal and at one with thee. There do thou rest the night,\\nand bid him go to the city to bear tidings of thy coming to\\nthe wise Penelope, how that she hath got thee safe, and\\nthou art come up out of Pylos.\\'\\n\\nTherewith she departed to high Olympus. But Telemachus woke\\nthe son of Nestor out of sweet sleep, touching him with his\\nheel, and spake to him, saying:\\n\\n\\'Awake, Peisistratus, son of Nestor, bring up thy horses of\\nsolid hoof, and yoke them beneath the car, that we may get\\nforward on the road.\\'\\n\\nThen Peisistratus, son of Nestor, answered him, saying:\\n\\'Telemachus, we may in no wise drive through the dark\\nnight, how eager soever to be gone; nay, soon it will be\\ndawn. Tarry then, till the hero, the son of Atreus,\\nspear-famed Menelaus, brings gifts, and sets them on the\\ncar, and bespeaks thee kindly, and sends thee on thy way.\\nFor of him a guest is mindful all the days of his life,\\neven of the host that shows him loving-kindness.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and anon came the golden-throned Dawn. And\\nMenelaus, of the loud war cry, drew nigh to them, new risen\\nfrom his bed, by fair-haired Helen. Now when the dear son\\nof Odysseus marked him, he made haste and girt his shining\\ndoublet about him, and the hero cast a great mantle over\\nhis mighty shoulders, and went forth at the door, and\\nTelemachus, dear son of divine Odysseus, came up and spake\\nto Menelaus, saying:\\n\\n\\'Menelaus, son of Atreus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the\\npeople, even now do thou speed me hence, to mine own dear\\ncountry; for even now my heart is fain to come home again.\\'\\n\\nThen Menelaus, of the loud war cry, answered him:\\n\\'Telemachus, as for me, I will not hold thee a long time\\nhere, that art eager to return; nay, I think it shame even\\nin another host, who loves overmuch or hates overmuch.\\nMeasure is best in all things. He does equal wrong who\\nspeeds a guest that would fain abide, and stays one who is\\nin haste to be gone. Men should lovingly entreat the\\npresent guest and speed the parting. But abide till I bring\\nfair gifts and set them on the car and thine own eyes\\nbehold them, and I bid the women to prepare the midday meal\\nin the halls, out of the good store they have within.\\nHonour and glory it is for us, and gain withal for thee,\\nthat ye should have eaten well ere ye go on your way, over\\nvast and limitless lands. What and if thou art minded to\\npass through Hellas and mid Argos? So shall I too go with\\nthee, and yoke thee horses and lead thee to the towns of\\nmen, and none shall send us empty away, but will give us\\nsome one thing to take with us, either a tripod of goodly\\nbronze or a cauldron, or two mules or a golden chalice.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him saying: \\'Menelaus, son of\\nAtreus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the people, rather\\nwould I return even now to mine own land, for I left none\\nbehind to watch over my goods when I departed. I would not\\nthat I myself should perish on the quest of my godlike\\nfather, nor that any good heir-loom should be lost from my\\nhalls.\\'\\n\\nNow when Menelaus, of the loud war cry, heard this saying,\\nstraightway he bade his wife and maids to prepare the\\nmidday meal in the halls, out of the good store they had by\\nthem. Then Eteoneus, son of Boethous, came nigh him, just\\nrisen from his bed, for he abode not far from him. Him\\nMenelaus of the loud war cry bade kindle the fire and roast\\nof the flesh; and he hearkened and obeyed. Then the prince\\nwent down into the fragrant treasure chamber, not alone,\\nfor Helen went with him, and Megapenthes. Now, when they\\ncame to the place where the treasures were stored, then\\nAtrides took a two-handled cup, and bade his son\\nMegapenthes to bear a mixing bowl of silver. And Helen\\nstood by the coffers, wherein were her robes of curious\\nneedlework which she herself had wrought. Then Helen, the\\nfair lady, lifted one and brought it out, the widest and\\nmost beautifully embroidered of all, and it shone like a\\nstar, and lay far beneath the rest.\\n\\nThen they went forth through the house till they came to\\nTelemachus; and Menelaus, of the fair hair, spake to him\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, may Zeus the thunderer, and the lord of Here,\\nin very truth bring about thy return according to the\\ndesire of thy heart. And of the gifts, such as are\\ntreasures stored in my house, I will give thee the\\ngoodliest and greatest of price. I will give thee a mixing\\nbowl beautifully wrought; it is all of silver and the lips\\nthereof are finished with gold, the work of Hephaestus; and\\nthe hero Phaedimus the king of the Sidonians, gave it to me\\nwhen his house sheltered me, on my coming thither. This cup\\nI would give to thee.\\'\\n\\nTherewith the hero Atrides set the two-handled cup in his\\nhands. And the strong Megapenthes bare the shining silver\\nbowl and set it before him. And Helen came up, beautiful\\nHelen, with the robe in her hands, and spake and hailed\\nhim:\\n\\n\\'Lo! I too give thee this gift, dear child, a memorial of\\nthe hands of Helen, against the day of thy desire, even of\\nthy bridal, for thy bride to wear it. But meanwhile let it\\nlie by thy dear mother in her chamber. And may joy go with\\nthee to thy well-builded house, and thine own country.\\'\\n\\nWith that she put it into his hands, and he took it and was\\nglad. And the hero Peisistratus took the gifts and laid\\nthem in the chest of the car, and gazed on all and\\nwondered. Then Menelaus of the fair hair led them to the\\nhouse. Then they twain sat them down on chairs and high\\nseats, and a handmaid bare water for the hands in a goodly\\ngolden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin to\\nwash withal, and drew to their side a polished table. And a\\ngrave dame bare wheaten bread and set it by them, and laid\\non the board many dainties, giving freely of such things as\\nshe had by her. And the son of Boethous carved by the board\\nand divided the messes, and the son of renowned Menelaus\\npoured forth the wine. So they stretched forth their hands\\nupon the good cheer set before them. Now when they had put\\nfrom them the desire of meat and drink, then did Telemachus\\nand the glorious son of Nestor yoke the horses and climb\\ninto the inlaid car. And they drave forth from the gateway\\nand the echoing gallery. After these Menelaus, of the fair\\nhair, the son of Atreus, went forth bearing in his right\\nhand a golden cup of honey-hearted wine, that they might\\npour a drink-offering ere they departed. And he stood\\nbefore the horses and spake his greeting:\\n\\n\\'Farewell, knightly youths, and salute in my name Nestor,\\nthe shepherd of the people; for truly he was gentle to me\\nas a father, while we sons of the Achaeans warred in the\\nland of Troy.\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Yea verily, O\\nfosterling of Zeus, we will tell him all on our coming even\\nas thou sayest. Would God that when I return to Ithaca I\\nmay find Odysseus in his home and tell him all, so surely\\nas now I go on my way having met with all loving-kindness\\nat thy hands, and take with me treasures many and goodly!\\'\\n\\nAnd even as he spake a bird flew forth at his right hand,\\nan eagle that bare in his claws a great white goose, a tame\\nfowl from the yard, and men and women followed shouting.\\nBut the bird drew near them and flew off to the right,\\nacross the horses, and they that saw it were glad, and\\ntheir hearts were all comforted within them. And\\nPeisistratus, son of Nestor, first spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Consider, Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the\\npeople, whether god hath showed forth this sign for us\\ntwain, or for thee thyself.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and the warrior Menelaus pondered thereupon,\\nhow he should take heed to answer, and interpret it aright.\\n\\nAnd long-robed Helen took the word and spake, saying: \\'Hear\\nme, and I will prophesy as the immortals put it into my\\nheart, and as I deem it will be accomplished. Even as\\nyonder eagle came down from the hill, the place of his\\nbirth and kin, and snatched away the goose that was\\nfostered in the house, even so shall Odysseus return home\\nafter much trial and long wanderings and take vengeance;\\nyea, or even now is he at home and sowing the seeds of evil\\nfor all the wooers.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered her, saying: \\'Now may Zeus\\nordain it so, Zeus the thunderer and the lord of Here. Then\\nwould I do thee worship, as to a god, even in my home\\nafar.\\'\\n\\nHe spake and smote the horses with the lash, and they sped\\nquickly towards the plain, in eager course through the\\ncity. So all day long they swayed the yoke they bore upon\\ntheir necks. And the sun sank, and all the ways were\\ndarkened. And they came to Pherae, to the house of Diocles,\\nson of Orsilochus, the child begotten of Alpheus. There\\nthey rested for the night, and by them he set the\\nentertainment of strangers.\\n\\nNow so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,\\nthey yoked the horses and mounted the inlaid car. And forth\\nthey drave from the gateway and the echoing gallery. And he\\ntouched the horses with the whip to start them, and the\\npair flew onward nothing loth. And soon thereafter they\\nreached the steep hold of Pylos. Then Telemachus spake unto\\nthe son of Nestor, saying:\\n\\n\\'Son of Nestor, in what wise mightest thou make me a\\npromise and fulfil my bidding? For we claim to be friends\\nby reason of our fathers\\' friendship from of old. Moreover\\nwe are equals in age, and this journey shall turn to our\\ngreater love. Take me not hence past my ship, O fosterling\\nof Zeus, but leave me there, lest that old man keep me in\\nhis house in my despite, out of his eager kindness, for I\\nmust go right quickly home.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and the some of Nestor communed with his own\\nheart how he might make promise, and duly fulfil the same.\\nSo as he thought thereon, in this wise it seemed to him\\nbest. He turned back his horses toward the swift ship and\\nthe sea-banks, and took forth the fair gifts and set them\\nin the hinder part of the ship, the raiment and the gold\\nwhich Menelaus gave him. And he called to Telemachus and\\nspake to him winged words:\\n\\n\\'Now climb the ship with all haste, and bid all thy company\\ndo likewise, ere I reach home and bring the old man word.\\nFor well I know in my mind and heart that, being so wilful\\nof heart, he will not let thee go, but he himself will come\\nhither to bid thee to his house, and methinks that he will\\nnot go back without thee; for very wroth will he be despite\\nthine excuse.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and drave the horses with the flowing manes\\nback to the town of the Pylians, and came quickly to the\\nhalls. And Telemachus called to his companions and\\ncommanded them, saying:\\n\\n\\'Set ye the gear in order, my friends, in the black ship,\\nand let us climb aboard that we may make way upon our\\ncourse.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and they gave good heed and hearkened. Then\\nstraightway they embarked and sat upon the benches.\\n\\nThus was he busy hereat and praying and making\\nburnt-offering to Athene, by the stern of the ship, when\\nthere drew nigh him one from a far country, that had slain\\nhis man and was fleeing from out of Argos. He was a\\nsoothsayer, and by his lineage he came of Melampus, who of\\nold time abode in Pylos, mother of flocks, a rich man and\\none that had an exceeding goodly house among the Pylians,\\nbut afterward he had come to the land of strangers, fleeing\\nfrom his country and from Neleus, the great-hearted, the\\nproudest of living men, who kept all his goods for a full\\nyear by force. All that time Melampus lay bound with hard\\nbonds in the halls of Phylacus, suffering strong pains for\\nthe sake of the daughter of Neleus, and for the dread\\nblindness of soul which the goddess, the Erinnys of the\\ndolorous stroke, had laid on him. Howsoever he escaped his\\nfate, and drave away the lowing kine from Phylace to Pylos,\\nand avenged the foul deed upon godlike Neleus, and brought\\nthe maiden home to his own brother to wife. As for him, he\\nwent to a country of other men, to Argos, the pastureland\\nof horses; for there truly it was ordained that he should\\ndwell, bearing rule over many of the Argives. There he\\nwedded a wife, and builded him a lofty house, and begat\\nAntiphates and Mantius, two mighty sons. Now Antiphates\\nbegat Oicles the great-hearted, and Oicles Amphiaraus, the\\nrouser of the host, whom Zeus, lord of the aegis, and\\nApollo loved with all manner of love. Yet he reached not\\nthe threshold of old age, but died in Thebes by reason of a\\nwoman\\'s gifts. And the sons born to him were Alcmaeon and\\nAmphilochus. But Mantius begat Polypheides and Cleitus; but\\nit came to pass that the golden-throned Dawn snatched away\\nCleitus for his very beauty\\'s sake, that he might dwell\\nwith the Immortals.\\n\\nAnd Apollo made the high-souled Polypheides a seer, far the\\nchief of human kind, Amphiaraus being now dead. He removed\\nhis dwelling to Hypheresia, being angered with his father,\\nand here he abode and prophesied to all men.\\n\\nThis man\\'s son it was, Theoclymenus by name, that now drew\\nnigh and stood by Telemachus. And he found him pouring a\\ndrink-offering and praying by the swift black ship, and\\nuttering his voice he spake to him winged words:\\n\\n\\'Friend, since I find thee making burnt-offering in this\\nplace, I pray thee, by thine offerings and by the god, and\\nthereafter by thine own head, and in the name of the men of\\nthy company answer my question truly and hide it not. Who\\nart thou of the sons of men and whence? Where is thy city,\\nwhere are they that begat thee?\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Yea now,\\nstranger, I will plainly tell thee all. Of Ithaca am I by\\nlineage, and my father is Odysseus, if ever such an one\\nthere was, but now hath he perished by an evil fate.\\nWherefore I have taken my company and a black ship, and\\nhave gone forth to hear word of my father that has been\\nlong afar.\\'\\n\\nThen godlike Theoclymenus spake to him again: \\'Even so I\\ntoo have fled from my country, for the manslaying of one of\\nmine own kin. And many brethren and kinsmen of the slain\\nare in Argos, the pastureland of horses, and rule mightily\\nover the Achaeans. Wherefore now am I an exile to shun\\ndeath and black fate at their hands, for it is my doom yet\\nto wander among men. Now set me on board ship, since I\\nsupplicate thee in my flight, lest they slay me utterly;\\nfor methinks they follow hard after me.\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Surely I will\\nnot drive thee away from our good ship, if thou art fain to\\ncome. Follow thou with us then, and in Ithaca thou shalt be\\nwelcome to such things as we have.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he took from him his spear of bronze, and laid it\\nalong the deck of the curved ship, and himself too climbed\\nthe seafaring ship. Then he sat him down in the stern and\\nmade Theoclymenus to sit beside him; and his company loosed\\nthe hawsers. Then Telemachus called unto his company, and\\nbade them lay hands on the tackling, and speedily they\\nhearkened to his call. So they raised the mast of pine\\ntree, and set it in the hole of the cross plank and made it\\nfast with forestays, and hauled up the white sails with\\ntwisted ropes of ox-hide. And grey-eyed Athene sent them a\\nfavouring breeze, rushing violently through the clear sky\\nthat the ship might speedily finish her course over the\\nsalt water of the sea. So they passed by Crouni and\\nChalcis, a land of fair streams.\\n\\nAnd the sun set and all the ways were darkened. And the\\nvessel drew nigh to Pheae, being sped before the breeze of\\nZeus, and then passed goodly Elis where the Epeans bear\\nrule. From thence he drave on again to the Pointed Isles,\\npondering whether he should escape death or be cut off.\\n\\nNow Odysseus and the goodly swineherd were supping in the\\nhut, and the other men sat at meat with them. So when they\\nhad put from them the desire of meat and drink, Odysseus\\nspake among them, to prove the swineherd, whether he would\\nstill entertain him diligently, and bid him abide there in\\nthe steading or send him forward to the city:\\n\\n\\'Listen now, Eumaeus, and all the others of the company. In\\nthe morning I would fain be gone to the town to go a\\nbegging, that I be not ruinous to thyself and thy fellows.\\nNow advise me well, and lend me a good guide by the way to\\nlead me thither; and through the city will I wander alone\\nas needs I must, if perchance one may give me a cup of\\nwater and a morsel of bread. Moreover I would go to the\\nhouse of divine Odysseus and bear tidings to the wise\\nPenelope, and consort with the wanton wooers, if haply they\\nmight grant me a meal out of the boundless store that they\\nhave by them. Lightly might I do good service among them,\\neven all that they would. For lo! I will tell thee and do\\nthou mark and listen. By the favour of Hermes, the\\nmessenger, who gives grace and glory to all men\\'s work, no\\nmortal may vie with me in the business of a serving-man, in\\npiling well a fire, in cleaving dry faggots, and in carving\\nand roasting flesh and in pouring of wine, those offices\\nwherein meaner men serve their betters.\\'\\n\\nThen didst thou speak to him in heaviness of heart,\\nswineherd Eumaeus: \\'Ah! wherefore, stranger, hath such a\\nthought arisen in thine heart? Surely thou art set on\\nperishing utterly there, if thou wouldest indeed go into\\nthe throng of the wooers, whose outrage and violence\\nreacheth even to the iron heaven! Not such as thou are\\ntheir servants; they that minister to them are young and\\ngaily clad in mantles and in doublets, and their heads are\\nanointed with oil and they are fair of face, and the\\npolished boards are laden with bread and flesh and wine.\\nNay, abide here, for none is vexed by thy presence, neither\\nI nor any of my fellows that are with me. But when the dear\\nson of Odysseus comes, he himself will give thee a mantle\\nand a doublet for raiment, and will send thee whithersoever\\nthy heart and spirit bid thee go.\\'\\n\\nThen the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him: \\'Oh, that\\nthou mayst so surely be dear to father Zeus as thou art to\\nme, in that thou didst make me to cease from wandering and\\ndread woe! For there is no other thing more mischievous to\\nmen than roaming; yet for their cursed belly\\'s need men\\nendure sore distress, to whom come wandering and\\ntribulation and pain. But behold now, since thou stayest me\\nhere, and biddest me wait his coming, tell me of the mother\\nof divine Odysseus, and of the father whom at his departure\\nhe left behind him on the threshold of old age; are they,\\nit may be, yet alive beneath the sunlight, or already dead\\nand within the house of Hades?\\'\\n\\nThen spake to him the swineherd, a master of men: \\'Yea now,\\nstranger, I will plainly tell thee all. Laertes yet lives,\\nand prays evermore to Zeus that his life may waste from out\\nhis limbs within his halls. For he has wondrous sorrow for\\nhis son that is far away, and for the wedded lady his wise\\nwife, whose death afflicted him in chief and brought him to\\nold age before his day. Now she died of very grief for her\\nson renowned, by an evil death, so may no man perish who\\ndwells here and is a friend to me in word and deed! So long\\nas she was on earth, though in much sorrow, I was glad to\\nask and enquire concerning her, for that she herself had\\nreared me along with long-robed Ctimene, her noble\\ndaughter, the youngest of her children. With her I was\\nreared, and she honoured me little less than her own. But\\nwhen we both came to the time of our desire, to the flower\\nof age, thereupon they sent her to Same, and got a great\\nbride-price; but my lady clad me in a mantle and a doublet,\\nraiment very fair, and gave me sandals for my feet and sent\\nme forth to the field, and right dear at heart she held me.\\nBut of these things now at last am I lacking; yet the\\nblessed gods prosper the work of mine own hands, whereat I\\nabide. Of this my substance I have eaten and drunken and\\ngiven to reverend strangers. But from my lady I may hear\\nnaught pleasant, neither word nor deed, for evil hath\\nfallen on her house, a plague of froward men; yet thralls\\nhave a great desire to speak before their mistress and find\\nout all eat and drink, and moreover to carry off somewhat\\nwith them to the field, such things as ever comfort the\\nheart of a thrall.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: \\'Ah,\\nEumaeus, how far then didst thou wander from thine own\\ncountry and thy parents while as yet thou wast but a child!\\nBut come, declare me this and plainly tell it all. Was a\\nwide-wayed town of men taken and sacked, wherein dwelt thy\\nfather and thy lady mother, or did unfriendly men find thee\\nlonely, tending sheep or cattle, and shipped thee thence,\\nand sold thee into the house of thy master here, who paid\\nfor thee a goodly price?\\'\\n\\nThen spake to him the swineherd, a master of men: Stranger,\\nsince thou askest and questionest me hereof, give heed now\\nin silence and make merry, and abide here drinking wine.\\nLo, the nights now are of length untold. Time is there to\\nsleep, and time to listen and be glad; thou needest not\\nturn to bed before the hour; even too much sleep is\\nvexation of spirit. But for the rest, let him whose heart\\nand mind bid him, go forth and slumber, and at the dawning\\nof the day let him break his fast, and follow our master\\'s\\nswine. But let us twain drink and feast within the\\nsteading, and each in his neighbour\\'s sorrows take delight,\\nrecalling them, for even the memory of griefs is a joy to a\\nman who hath been sore tried and wandered far. Wherefore I\\nwill tell thee that whereof thou askest and dost question\\nme.\\n\\n\\'There is a certain isle called Syria, if haply thou hast\\nheard tell of it, over above Ortygia, and there are the\\nturning-places of the sun. It is not very great in compass,\\nthough a goodly isle, rich in herds, rich in flocks, with\\nplenty of corn and wine. Dearth never enters the land, and\\nno hateful sickness falls on wretched mortals. But when the\\ntribes of men grow old in that city, then comes Apollo of\\nthe silver bow, with Artemis, and slays them with the\\nvisitation of his gentle shafts. In that isle are two\\ncities, and the whole land is divided between them, and my\\nfather was king over the twain, Ctesius son of Ormenus, a\\nman like to the Immortals.\\n\\n\\'Thither came the Phoenicians, mariners renowned, greedy\\nmerchant men, with countless gauds in a black ship. Now in\\nmy father\\'s house was a Phoenician woman, tall and fair and\\nskilled in bright handiwork; this woman the Phoenicians\\nwith their sleights beguiled. First as she was washing\\nclothes, one of them lay with her in love by the hollow\\nship, for love beguiles the minds of womankind, even of the\\nupright. Then he asked her who she was and whence she came,\\nand straightway she showed him the lofty home of my father,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'\"From out of Sidon I avow that I come, land rich in\\nbronze, and I am the daughter of Arybas, the deeply\\nwealthy. But Taphians, who were sea-robbers, laid hands on\\nme and snatched me away as I came in from the fields, and\\nbrought me hither and sold me into the house of my master,\\nwho paid for me a goodly price.\"\\n\\n\\'Then the man who had lain with her privily, answered:\\n\"Say, wouldst thou now return home with us, that thou mayst\\nlook again on the lofty house of thy father and mother and\\non their faces? For truly they yet live, and have a name\\nfor wealth.\"\\n\\n\\'Then the woman answered him and spake, saying: \"Even this\\nmay well be, if ye sailors will pledge me an oath to bring\\nme home in safety.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, and they all swore thereto as she bade them.\\nNow when they had sworn and done that oath, again the woman\\nspake among them and answered, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Hold your peace now, and let none of your fellows speak\\nto me and greet me, if they meet me in the street, or even\\nat the well, lest one go and tell it to the old man at\\nhome, and he suspect somewhat and bind me in hard bonds and\\ndevise death for all of you. But keep ye the matter in\\nmind, and speed the purchase of your homeward freight. And\\nwhen your ship is freighted with stores, let a message come\\nquickly to me at the house; for I will likewise bring gold,\\nall that comes under my hand. Yea and there is another\\nthing that I would gladly give for my fare. I am nurse to\\nthe child of my lord in the halls, a most cunning little\\nboy, that runs out and abroad with me. Him would I bring on\\nboard ship, and he should fetch you a great price,\\nwheresoever ye take him for sale among men of strange\\nspeech.\"\\n\\n\\'Therewith she went her way to the fair halls. But they\\nabode among us a whole year, and got together much wealth\\nin their hollow ship. And when their hollow ship was now\\nladen to depart, they sent a messenger to tell the tidings\\nto the woman. There came a man versed in craft to my\\nfather\\'s house, with a golden chain strung here and there\\nwith amber beads. Now the maidens in the hall and my lady\\nmother were handling the chain and gazing on it, and\\noffering him their price; but he had signed silently to the\\nwoman, and therewithal gat him away to the hollow ship.\\nThen she took me by the hand and led me forth from the\\nhouse. And at the vestibule of the house she found the cups\\nand the tables of the guests that had been feasting, who\\nwere in waiting on my father. They had gone forth to the\\nsession and the place of parley of the people. And she\\nstraightway hid three goblets in her bosom, and bare them\\naway, and I followed in my innocence. Then the sun sank and\\nall the ways were darkened and we went quickly and came to\\nthe good haven, where was the swift ship of the\\nPhoenicians. So they climbed on board and took us up with\\nthem, and sailed over the wet ways, and Zeus sent us a\\nfavouring wind. For six days we sailed by day and night\\ncontinually; but when Zeus, son of Cronos, added the\\nseventh day thereto, then Artemis, the archer, smote the\\nwoman that she fell, as a sea-swallow falls, with a plunge\\ninto the hold. And they cast her forth to be the prey of\\nseals and fishes, but I was left stricken at heart. And\\nwind and water bare them and brought them to Ithaca, where\\nLaertes bought me with his possessions. And thus it chanced\\nthat mine eyes beheld this land.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus, of the seed of Zeus, answered him saying:\\n\\n\\'Eumaeus, verily thou hast stirred my heart within me with\\nthe tale of all these things, of all the sorrow of heart\\nthou hast endured. Yet surely Zeus hath given thee good as\\nwell as evil, since after all these adventures thou hast\\ncome to the house of a kindly man, who is careful to give\\nthee meat and drink and right well thou livest. But I have\\ncome hither still wandering through the many towns of men.\\'\\n\\nThus they spake one with the other. Then they laid them\\ndown to sleep for no long while, but for a little space,\\nfor soon came the throned Dawn. But on the shore the\\ncompany of Telemachus were striking their sails, and took\\ndown the mast quickly and rowed the ship on to anchorage.\\nAnd they cast anchors and made fast the hawsers, and\\nthemselves too stept forth upon the strand of the sea, and\\nmade ready the midday meal, and mixed the dark wine. Now\\nwhen they had put from them the desire of meat and drink,\\nwise Telemachus first spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Do ye now drive the black ship to the city, while I will\\ngo to the fields and to the herdsmen, and at even I will\\nreturn to the city, when I have seen my lands. And in the\\nmorning I will set by you the wages of the voyage, a good\\nfeast of flesh and of sweet wine.\\'\\n\\nThen godlike Theoclymenus answered him: \\'And whither shall\\nI go, dear child? To what man\\'s house shall I betake me, of\\nsuch as are lords in rocky Ithaca? Shall I get me straight\\nto thy mother and to thy home?\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'In other case I\\nwould bid thee go even to our own house; for there is no\\nlack of cheer for strangers, but now would it be worse for\\nthyself, forasmuch as I shall be away nor would my mother\\nsee thee. For she comes not often in sight of the wooers in\\nthe house, but abides apart from them in her upper chamber,\\nand weaves at her web. Yet there is one whom I will tell\\nthee of, to whom thou mayst go, Eurymachus the glorious son\\nof wise Polybus, whom now the men of Ithaca look upon, even\\nas if he were a god. For he is far the best man of them\\nall, and is most eager to wed my mother and to have the\\nsovereignty of Odysseus. Howbeit, Olympian Zeus, that\\ndwells in the clear sky, knows hereof, whether or no he\\nwill fulfill for them the evil day before their marriage.\\'\\n\\nNow even as he spake, a bird flew out on the right, a hawk,\\nthe swift messenger of Apollo. In his talons he held a dove\\nand plucked her, and shed the feathers down to the earth,\\nmidway between the ship and Telemachus himself. Then\\nTheoclymenus called him apart from his fellows, and clasped\\nhis hand and spake and hailed him:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, surely not without the god\\'s will hath the\\nbird flown out on the right, for I knew when I saw him that\\nhe was a bird of omen. There is no other house more kingly\\nthan yours in the land of Ithaca; nay, ye have ever the\\nmastery.\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Ah, stranger,\\nwould that this word may be accomplished! Soon shouldest\\nthou be aware of kindness and many a gift at my hands, so\\nthat whoso met with thee would call thee blessed.\\'\\n\\nThen he spake to Piraeus, his trusty companion: \\'Piraeus,\\nson of Clytius, thou that at other seasons hearkenest to me\\nabove all my company who went with me to Pylos, even now, I\\npray, lead this stranger home with thee, and give heed to\\ntreat him lovingly and with worship in thy house till I\\ncome.\\'\\n\\nThen Piraeus, spearsman renowned, answered him saying:\\n\\'Telemachus, why, even if thou shouldest tarry here long,\\nyet will I entertain this man, and he shall have no lack of\\nstranger\\'s cheer.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he went on board, and bade his men themselves to\\nmount and loose the hawsers. And quickly they embarked and\\nsat upon the benches. And Telemachus bound his goodly\\nsandals beneath his feet, and seized a mighty spear, shod\\nwith sharp bronze, from the deck of the ship and his men\\nloosed the hawsers. So they thrust off and sailed to the\\ncity, as Telemachus bade them, the dear son of divine\\nOdysseus. But swiftly his feet bore him on his forward way,\\ntill he came to the court, where were his swine out of\\nnumber; and among them the good swineherd slept, a man\\nloyal to his lords.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XVI\\n\\n  Telemachus sends Eumaeus to the city to tell his mother of\\n  his return. And how, in the meantime, Odysseus discovers\\n  himself to his son.\\n\\nNow these twain, Odysseus and the goodly swineherd, within\\nthe hut had kindled a fire, and were making ready breakfast\\nat the dawn, and had sent forth the herdsmen with the\\ndroves of swine. And round Telemachus the hounds, that love\\nto bark, fawned and barked not, as he drew nigh. And goodly\\nOdysseus took note of the fawning of the dogs, and the\\nnoise of footsteps fell upon his ears. Then straight he\\nspake to Eumaeus winged words:\\n\\n\\'Eumaeus, verily some friend or some other of thy familiars\\nwill soon be here, for the dogs do not bark but fawn\\naround, and I catch the sound of footsteps.\\'\\n\\nWhile the word was yet on his lips, his own dear son stood\\nat the entering in of the gate. Then the swineherd sprang\\nup in amazement, and out of his hands fell the vessels\\nwherewith he was busied in mingling the dark wine. And he\\ncame over against his master and kissed his head and both\\nhis beautiful eyes and both his hands, and he let a great\\ntear fall. And even as a loving father welcomes his son\\nthat has come in the tenth year from a far country, his\\nonly son and well-beloved, for whose sake he has had great\\nsorrow and travail, even so did the goodly swineherd fall\\nupon the neck of godlike Telemachus, and kiss him all over\\nas one escaped from death, and he wept aloud and spake to\\nhim winged words:\\n\\n\\'Thou art come, Telemachus, a sweet light in the dark;\\nmethought I should see thee never again, after thou hadst\\ngone in thy ship to Pylos. Nay now enter, dear child, that\\nmy heart may be glad at the sight of thee in mine house,\\nwho hast newly come from afar. For thou dost not often\\nvisit the field and the herdsmen, but abidest in the town;\\nso it seems has thy good pleasure been, to look on the\\nruinous throng of the wooers.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'So be it,\\nfather, as thou sayest; and for thy sake am I come hither\\nto see thee with mine eyes, and to hear from thy lips\\nwhether my mother yet abides in the halls or another has\\nalready wedded her, and the couch of Odysseus, perchance,\\nlies in lack of bedding and deep in foul spider-webs.\\'\\n\\nThen the swineherd, a master of men, answered him: \\'Yea\\nverily, she abides with patient spirit in thy halls, and\\nwearily for her the nights wane always and the days, in\\nshedding of tears.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake and took from him the spear of bronze. Then\\nTelemachus passed within and crossed the threshold of\\nstone. As he came near, his father Odysseus arose from his\\nseat to give him place; but Telemachus, on his part, stayed\\nhim and spake saying:\\n\\n\\'Be seated, stranger, and we will find a seat some other\\nwhere in our steading, and there is a man here to set it\\nfor us.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and Odysseus went back and sat him down again.\\nAnd the swineherd strewed for Telemachus green brushwood\\nbelow, and a fleece thereupon, and there presently the dear\\nson of Odysseus sat him down. Next the swineherd set by\\nthem platters of roast flesh, the fragments that were left\\nfrom the meal of yesterday. And wheaten bread he briskly\\nheaped up in baskets, and mixed the honey-sweet wine in a\\ngoblet of ivy wood, and himself sat down over against\\ndivine Odysseus. So they stretched forth their hands upon\\nthe good cheer set before them. Now when they had put from\\nthem the desire of meat and drink, Telemachus spake to the\\ngoodly swineherd, saying:\\n\\n\\'Father, whence came this stranger to thee? How did sailors\\nbring him to Ithaca? and who did they avow them to be? For\\nin no wise, I deem, did he come hither by land.\\'\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: \\'Yea now,\\nmy son, I will tell thee all the truth. Of wide Crete he\\navows him to be by lineage, and he says that round many\\ncities of mortals he has wandered at adventure; even so has\\nsome god spun for him the thread of fate. But now, as a\\nrunaway from a ship of the Thesprotians, has he come to my\\nsteading, and I will give him to thee for thy man; do with\\nhim as thou wilt; he avows him for thy suppliant.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Eumaeus, verily\\na bitter word is this that thou speakest. How indeed shall\\nI receive this guest in my house? Myself I am young, and\\ntrust not yet to my strength of hands to defend me against\\nthe man who does violence without a cause. And my mother\\nhas divisions of heart, whether to abide here with me and\\nkeep the house, respecting the bed of her lord and the\\nvoice of the people, or straightway to go with whomsoever\\nof the Achaeans that woo her in the halls is the best man,\\nand gives most bridal gifts. But behold, as for this guest\\nof thine, now that he has come to thy house, I will clothe\\nhim in a mantle and a doublet, goodly raiment, and I will\\ngive him a two-edged sword, and shoes for his feet, and\\nsend him on his way, whithersoever his heart and his spirit\\nbid him go. Or, if thou wilt, hold him here in the steading\\nand take care of him, and raiment I will send hither, and\\nall manner of food to eat, that he be not ruinous to thee\\nand to thy fellows. But thither into the company of the\\nwooers would I not suffer him to go, for they are exceeding\\nfull of infatuate insolence, lest they mock at him, and\\nthat would be a sore grief to me. And hard it is for one\\nman, how valiant soever, to achieve aught among a\\nmultitude, for verily they are far the stronger.\\'\\n\\nThen the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him: \\'My\\nfriend, since it is indeed my right to answer thee withal,\\nof a truth my heart is rent as I hear your words, such\\ninfatuate deeds ye say the wooers devise in the halls, in\\ndespite of thee, a man so noble. Say, dost thou willingly\\nsubmit thee to oppression, or do the people through the\\ntownship hate thee, obedient to the voice of a god? Or hast\\nthou cause to blame thy brethren, in whose battle a man\\nputs trust, even if a great feud arise? Ah, would that I\\nhad the youth, as now I have the spirit, and were either\\nthe son of noble Odysseus or Odysseus\\' very self, {*}\\nstraightway then might a stranger sever my head from off my\\nneck, if I went not to the halls of Odysseus, son of\\nLaertes, and made myself the bane of every man among them!\\nBut if they should overcome me by numbers, being but one\\nman against so many, far rather would I die slain in mine\\nown halls, than witness for ever these unseemly deeds,\\nstrangers shamefully entreated, and men haling the\\nhandmaidens in foul wise through the fair house, and wine\\ndrawn wastefully and the wooers devouring food all\\nrecklessly without avail, at a work that knows no ending.\\'\\n\\n{* We omit line 101, which spoils the sense of the passage,\\nand was rejected by antiquity.}\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Yea now,\\nstranger I will plainly tell thee all. There is no grudge\\nand hatred borne my by the whole people, neither have I\\ncause to blame my brethren, in whose battle a man puts\\ntrust, even if a great feud arise. For thus, as thou seest,\\nCronion has made us a house of but one heir. Arceisius got\\nhim one only son Laertes, and one only son Odysseus was\\nbegotten of his father, and Odysseus left me the only child\\nof his getting in these halls, and had no joy of me;\\nwherefore now are foemen innumerable in the house. For all\\nthe noblest that are princes in the islands, in Dulichium\\nand Same and wooded Zacynthus, and as many as lord it in\\nrocky Ithaca, all these woo my mother and waste my house.\\nBut as for her she neither refuseth the hated bridal, nor\\nhath the heart to make and end; so they devour and minish\\nmy house; and ere long will they make havoc likewise of\\nmyself. Howbeit these things surely lie on the knees of the\\ngods. Nay, father, but do thou go with haste and tell the\\nconstant Penelope that she hath got me safe and that I am\\ncome up out of Pylos. As for me, I will tarry here, and do\\nthou return hither when thou hast told the tidings to her\\nalone; but of the other Achaeans let no man learn it, for\\nthere be many that devise mischief against me.\\'\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: \\'I mark, I\\nheed, all this thou speakest to one with understanding. But\\ncome, declare me this and tell it plainly; whether or no I\\nshall go the same road with tidings to Laertes, that\\nhapless man, who till lately, despite his great sorrow for\\nOdysseus\\' sake, yet had oversight of the tillage, and did\\neat and drink with the thralls in his house, as often as\\nhis heart within him bade him. But now, from the day that\\nthou wentest in thy ship to Pylos, never to this hour, they\\nsay, hath he so much as eaten and drunken, nor looked to\\nthe labours of the field, but with groaning and lamentation\\nhe sits sorrowing, and the flesh wastes away about his\\nbones.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'All the more\\ngrievous it is! yet will we let him be, though we sorrow\\nthereat. For if men might in any wise have all their will,\\nwe should before ought else choose the day of my father\\'s\\nreturning. But do thou when thou hast told the tidings come\\nstraight back, and go not wandering through the fields\\nafter Laertes. But speak to my mother that with all speed\\nshe send forth the house-dame her handmaid, secretly, for\\nshe might bear tidings to the old man.\\'\\n\\nWith that word he roused the swineherd, who took his\\nsandals in his hands and bound them beneath his feet and\\ndeparted for the city. Now Athene noted Eumaeus the\\nswineherd pass from the steading, and she drew nigh in the\\nsemblance of a woman fair and tall, and skilled in splendid\\nhandiwork. And she stood in presence manifest to Odysseus\\nover against the doorway of the hut; but it was so that\\nTelemachus saw her not before him and marked her not; for\\nthe gods in no wise appear visibly to all. But Odysseus was\\nware of her and the dogs likewise, which barked not, but\\nwith a low whine shrank cowering to the far side of the\\nsteading. Then she nodded at him with bent brows, and\\ngoodly Odysseus perceived it, and came forth from the room,\\npast the great wall of the yard, and stood before her, and\\nAthene spake to him, saying:\\n\\n\\'Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many\\ndevices, now is the hour to reveal thy word to thy son, and\\nhide it not, that ye twain having framed death and doom for\\nthe wooers, may fare to the famous town. Nor will I, even\\nI, be long away from you, being right eager for battle.\\'\\n\\nTherewith Athene touched him with her golden wand. First\\nshe cast about his breast a fresh linen robe and a doublet,\\nand she increased his bulk and bloom. Dark his colour grew\\nagain, and his cheeks filled out, and the black beard\\nspread thick around his chin.\\n\\nNow she, when she had so wrought, withdrew again, but\\nOdysseus went into the hut, and his dear son marvelled at\\nhim and looked away for very fear lest it should be a god,\\nand he uttered his voice and spake to him winged words:\\n\\n\\'Even now, stranger, thou art other in my sight than that\\nthou wert a moment since, and other garments thou hast, and\\nthe colour of thy skin is no longer the same. Surely thou\\nart a god of those that keep the wide heaven. Nay then, be\\ngracious, that we may offer to thee well-pleasing\\nsacrifices and golden gifts, beautifully wrought; and spare\\nus I pray thee.\\'\\n\\nThen the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him, saying:\\n\\'Behold, no god am I; why likenest thou me to the\\nimmortals? nay, thy father am I, for whose sake thou\\nsufferest many pains and groanest sore, and submittest thee\\nto the despite of men,\\'\\n\\nAt the word he kissed his son, and from his cheeks let a\\ntear fall to earth: before, he had stayed the tears\\ncontinually. But Telemachus (for as yet he believed not\\nthat it was his father) answered in turn and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Thou art not Odysseus my father, but some god beguiles me,\\nthat I may groan for more exceeding sorrow. For it cannot\\nbe that a mortal man should contrive this by the aid of his\\nown wit, unless a god were himself to visit him, and\\nlightly of his own will to make him young or old. For\\ntruly, but a moment gone, thou wert old and foully clad,\\nbut now thou art like the gods who keep the wide heaven.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying:\\n\\'Telemachus, it fits thee not to marvel overmuch that thy\\nfather is come home, or to be amazed. Nay for thou shalt\\nfind no other Odysseus come hither any more; but lo, I, all\\nas I am, after sufferings and much wandering have come in\\nthe twentieth year to mine own country. Behold, this is the\\nwork of Athene, driver of the spoil, who makes me such\\nmanner of man as she will,--for with her it is possible,--\\nnow like a beggar, and now again like a young man, and one\\nclad about in rich raiment. Easy it is for the gods who\\nkeep the wide heaven to glorify or to abase a mortal man.\\'\\n\\nWith this word then he sat down again; but Telemachus,\\nflinging himself upon his noble father\\'s neck, mourned and\\nshed tears, and in both their hearts arose the desire of\\nlamentation. And they wailed aloud, more ceaselessly than\\nbirds, sea-eagles or vultures of crooked claws, whose\\nyounglings the country folk have taken from the nest, ere\\nyet they are fledged. Even so pitifully fell the tears\\nbeneath their brows. And now would the sunlight have gone\\ndown upon their sorrowing, had not Telemachus spoken to his\\nfather suddenly:\\n\\n\\'And in what manner of ship, father dear, did sailors at\\nlength bring thee hither to Ithaca? and who did they avow\\nthem to be? For in no wise, I deem, didst thou come hither\\nby land.\\'\\n\\nAnd the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him: \\'Yea now,\\nmy child, I will tell thee all the truth. The Phaeacians\\nbrought me hither, mariners renowned, who speed other men\\ntoo upon their way, whosoever comes to them. Asleep in the\\nswift ship they bore me over the seas and set me down in\\nIthaca, and gave me splendid gifts, bronze and gold in\\nplenty and woven raiment. And these treasures are lying by\\nthe gods\\' grace in the caves. But now I am come hither by\\nthe promptings of Athene, that we may take counsel for the\\nslaughter of the foemen. But come, tell me all the tale of\\nthe wooers and their number, that I may know how many and\\nwhat men they be, and that so I may commune with my good\\nheart and advise me, whether we twain shall be able alone\\nto make head against them without aid, or whether we should\\neven seek succour of others.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Verily, father,\\nI have ever heard of thy great fame, for a warrior hardy of\\nthy hands, and sage in counsel. But this is a hard saying\\nof thine: awe comes over me; for it may not be that two men\\nshould do battle with many men and stalwart. For of the\\nwooers there are not barely ten nor twice ten only, but\\nmany a decad more: and straight shalt thou learn the tale\\nof them ere we part. From Dulichium there be two and fifty\\nchosen lords, and six serving men go with them; and out of\\nSame four and twenty men; and from Zacynthus there are\\ntwenty lords of the Achaeans; and from Ithaca itself full\\ntwelve men of the best, and with them Medon the henchman,\\nand the divine minstrel, and two squires skilled in carving\\nviands. If we shall encounter all these within the halls,\\nsee thou to it, lest bitter and baneful for us be the\\nvengeance thou takest on their violence at thy coming. But\\ndo thou, if thou canst think of some champion, advise thee\\nof any that may help us with all his heart.\\'\\n\\nThen the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him, saying:\\n\\'Yea now, I will tell thee, and do thou mark and listen to\\nme, and consider whether Athene with Father Zeus will\\nsuffice for us twain, or whether I shall cast about for\\nsome other champion.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Valiant\\nhelpers, in sooth, are these two thou namest, whose seat is\\naloft in the clouds, and they rule among all men and among\\nthe deathless gods!\\'\\n\\nThen the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him: \\'Yet will\\nthe twain not long keep aloof from the strong tumult of\\nwar, when between the wooers and us in my halls is held the\\ntrial of the might of Ares. But as now, do thou go homeward\\nat the breaking of the day, and consort with the proud\\nwooers. As for me, the swineherd will lead me to the town\\nlater in the day, in the likeness of a beggar, a wretched\\nman and an old. And if they shall evil entreat me in the\\nhouse, let thy heart harden itself to endure while I am\\nshamefully handled, yea even if they drag me by the feet\\nthrough the house to the doors, or cast at me and smite me:\\nstill do thou bear the sight. Howbeit thou shalt surely bid\\nthem cease from their folly, exhorting them with smooth\\nwords; yet no whit will they hearken, nay for the day of\\ntheir doom is at hand. Yet another thing will I tell thee,\\nand do thou ponder it in thy heart. When Athene, of deep\\ncounsel, shall put it into my heart, I will nod to thee\\nwith my head and do thou note it, and carry away all thy\\nweapons of war that lie in the halls, and lay them down\\nevery one in the secret place of the lofty chamber. And\\nwhen the wooers miss them and ask thee concerning them,\\nthou shalt beguile them with soft words, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Out of the smoke I laid them by, since they were no\\nlonger like those that Odysseus left behind him of old when\\nhe went to Troy, but they are wholly marred: so mightily\\nhath passed upon them the vapour of fire. Moreover Cronion\\nhath put into my heart this other and greater care, that\\nperchance, when ye are heated with wine, ye set a quarrel\\nbetween you and wound one the other and thereby shame the\\nfeast and the wooing; for iron of itself draws a man\\nthereto.\" But for us twain alone leave two swords and two\\nspears and two shields of oxhide to grasp, that we may rush\\nupon the arms and seize them; and then shall Pallas Athene\\nand Zeus the counsellor enchant the wooers to their ruin.\\nYet another thing will I tell thee, and do thou ponder it\\nin thy heart. If in very truth thou art my son and of our\\nblood, then let no man hear that Odysseus is come home;\\nneither let Laertes know it, nor the swineherd nor any of\\nthe household nor Penelope herself, but let me and thee\\nalone discover the intent of the women. Yea, and we would\\nmoreover make trial of certain of the men among the\\nthralls, and learn who {*} of them chances to honour us and\\nto fear us heartily, and who regards us not at all and\\nholds even thee in no esteem, so noble a man as thou art.\\'\\n\\n{* Reading [Greek]}\\n\\nThen his renowned son answered him, and said: \\'O my father,\\nof a truth thou shalt learn, methinks, even hereafter what\\nspirit I am of, for no whit doth folly possess me. But I\\ndeem not that this device of thine will be gainful to us\\ntwain, so I bid thee to give heed. For thou shalt be long\\ntime on thy road to little purpose, making trial of each\\nman, while thou visitest the farm lands; but at ease in thy\\nhalls the wooers devour thy goods with insolence, and now\\nthere is no sparing. Howbeit I would have thee take\\nknowledge of the women, who they be that dishonour thee,\\nand who are guiltless. But of the men I would not that we\\nshould make trial in the steadings, but that we should see\\nto this task afterwards, if indeed thou knowest some sign\\nfrom Zeus, lord of the aegis.\\'\\n\\nThus they spake one to the other. And now the well-builded\\nship was being brought to land at Ithaca, the ship that\\nbare Telemachus from Pylos with all his company. When they\\nwere now come within the deep harbour, the men drew up the\\nblack ship on the shore, while squires, haughty of heart,\\nbare away their weapons, and straightway carried the\\nglorious gifts to the house of Clytius. Anon they sent\\nforward a herald to the house of Odysseus to bear the\\ntidings to prudent Penelope, namely, how Telemachus was in\\nthe field, and had bidden the ship sail to the city, lest\\nthe noble queen should be afraid, and let the round tears\\nfall. So these two met, the herald and the goodly\\nswineherd, come on the same errand to tell all to the lady.\\nNow when they were got to the house of the divine king, the\\nherald spake out among all the handmaids saying:\\n\\n\\'Verily, O queen, thy son hath come out of Pylos.\\'\\n\\nBut the swineherd went up to Penelope, and told her all\\nthat her dear son had bidden him say. So, when he had\\ndeclared all that had been enjoined him, he went on his way\\nto the swine and left the enclosure and the hall.\\n\\nNow the wooers were troubled and downcast in spirit, and\\nforth they went from the hall past the great wall of the\\ncourt, and there in front of the gates they held their\\nsession. And Eurymachus son of Polybus first spake among\\nthem saying:\\n\\n\\'Verily, friends, a proud deed hath Telemachus accomplished\\nwith a high hand, even this journey, and we said that he\\nshould never bring it to pass. But come, launch we a black\\nship, the best there is, and let us get together oarsmen of\\nthe sea, who shall straightway bear word to our friends to\\nreturn home with speed.\\'\\n\\nThe word was yet on his lips, when Amphinomus turned in his\\nplace and saw the ship within the deep harbour, and the men\\nlowering the sails and with the oars in their hands. Then\\nsweetly he laughed out and spake among his fellows:\\n\\n\\'Nay, let us now send no message any more, for lo, they are\\ncome home. Either some god has told them all or they\\nthemselves have seen the ship of Telemachus go by, and have\\nnot been able to catch her.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and they arose and went to the sea-banks.\\nSwiftly the men drew up the black ship on the shore, and\\nsquires, haughty of heart, bare away their weapons. And the\\nwooers all together went to the assembly-place, and\\nsuffered none other to sit with them, either of the young\\nmen or of the elders. Then Antinous spake among them, the\\nson of Eupeithes:\\n\\n\\'Lo now, how the gods have delivered this man from his evil\\ncase! All day long did scouts sit along the windy\\nheadlands, ever in quick succession, and at the going down\\nof the sun we never rested for a night upon the shore, but\\nsailing with our swift ship on the high seas we awaited the\\nbright Dawn, as we lay in wait for Telemachus, that we\\nmight take and slay the man himself; but meanwhile some god\\nhas brought him home. But even here let us devise an evil\\nend for him, even for Telemachus, and let him not escape\\nout of our hands, for methinks that while he lives we shall\\nnever achieve this task of ours. For he himself has\\nunderstanding in counsel and wisdom, and the people no\\nlonger show us favour in all things. Nay come, before he\\nassembles all the Achaeans to the gathering; for methinks\\nthat he will in nowise be slack, but will be exceeding\\nwroth, and will stand up and speak out among them all, and\\ntell how we plotted against him sheer destruction but did\\nnot overtake him. Then will they not approve us, when they\\nhear these evil deeds. Beware then lest they do us a harm,\\nand drive us forth from our country, and we come to the\\nland of strangers. Nay, but let us be beforehand and take\\nhim in the field far from the city, or by the way; and let\\nus ourselves keep his livelihood and his possessions,\\nmaking fair division among us, but the house we would give\\nto his mother to keep and to whomsoever marries her. But if\\nthis saying likes you not, but ye chose rather that he\\nshould live and keep the heritage of his father, no longer\\nthen let us gather here and eat all his store of pleasant\\nsubstance, but let each one from his own hall woo her with\\nhis bridal gifts and seek to win her; so should she wed the\\nman that gives the most and comes as the chosen of fate.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and they all held their peace. Then Amphinomus\\nmade harangue and spake out among them; he was the famous\\nson of Nisus the prince, the son of Aretias, and he led the\\nwooers that came from out Dulichium, a land rich in wheat\\nand in grass, and more than all the rest his words were\\npleasing to Penelope, for he was of an understanding mind.\\nAnd now of his good will he made harangue, and spake among\\nthem:\\n\\n\\'Friends, I for one would not choose to kill Telemachus; it\\nis a fearful thing to slay one of the stock of kings! Nay,\\nfirst let us seek to the counsel of the gods, and if the\\noracles of great Zeus approve, myself I will slay him and\\nbid all the rest to aid. But if the gods are disposed to\\navert it, I bid you to refrain.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Amphinomus, and his saying pleased them well. Then\\nstraightway they arose and went to the house of Odysseus,\\nand entering in sat down on the polished seats.\\n\\nThen the wise Penelope had a new thought, namely, to show\\nherself to the wooers, so despiteful in their insolence;\\nfor she had heard of the death of her son that was to be in\\nthe halls, seeing that Medon the henchman had told her of\\nit; who heard their counsels. So she went on her way to the\\nhall, with the women her handmaids. Now when that fair lady\\nhad come unto the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the\\nwell-builded roof, holding up her glistening tire before\\nher face, and rebuked Antinous and spake and hailed him:\\n\\n\\'Antinous, full of all insolence, deviser of mischief! and\\nyet they say that in the land of Ithaca thou art chiefest\\namong thy peers in counsel and in speech. Nay, no such man\\ndost thou show thyself. Fool! why indeed dost thou contrive\\ndeath and doom for Telemachus, and hast no regard unto\\nsuppliants who have Zeus to witness? Nay but it is an\\nimpious thing to contrive evil one against another. What!\\nknowest thou not of the day when thy father fled to this\\nhouse in fear of the people, for verily they were exceeding\\nwroth against him, because he had followed with Taphian sea\\nrobbers and harried the Thesprotians, who were at peace\\nwith us. So they wished to destroy thy father and wrest\\nfrom him his dear life, and utterly to devour all his great\\nand abundant livelihood; but Odysseus stayed and withheld\\nthem, for all their desire. His house thou now consumest\\nwithout atonement, and his wife thou wooest, and wouldst\\nslay his son, and dost greatly grieve me. But I bid thee\\ncease, and command the others to do likewise.\\'\\n\\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered her saying:\\n\\'Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, take courage, and let\\nnot thy heart be careful for these things. The man is not,\\nnor shall be, nor ever shall be born, that shall stretch\\nforth his hands against Telemachus, thy son, while I live\\nand am on earth and see the light. For thus will I declare\\nto thee, and it shall surely come to pass. Right quickly\\nshall the black blood of such an one flow about our spear;\\nfor Odysseus, waster of cities, of a truth did many a time\\nset me too upon his knees, and gave me roasted flesh into\\nmy hand, and held the red wine to my lips. Wherefore\\nTelemachus is far the dearest of all men to me, and I bid\\nhim have no fear of death, not from the wooers\\' hands; but\\nfrom the gods none may avoid it.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake comforting her, but was himself the while\\nframing death for her son.\\n\\nNow she ascended to her shining upper chamber, and then was\\nbewailing Odysseus, her dear lord, till grey-eyed Athene\\ncast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\\n\\nAnd in the evening the goodly swineherd came back to\\nOdysseus and his son, and they made ready and served the\\nsupper, when they had sacrificed a swine of a year old.\\nThen Athene drew near Odysseus, son of Laertes, and smote\\nhim with her wand, and made him into an old man again. In\\nsorry raiment she clad him about his body, lest the\\nswineherd should look on him and know him, and depart to\\ntell the constant Penelope, and not keep the matter in his\\nheart.\\n\\nThen Telemachus spake first to the swineherd, saying:\\n\\'Thou hast come, goodly Eumaeus. What news is there in the\\ntown? Are the lordly wooers now come in from their ambush,\\nor do they still watch for me as before on my homeward\\nway?\\'\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: \\'I had no\\nmind to go down the city asking and inquiring hereof; my\\nheart bade me get me home again, as quick as might be, when\\nonce I had told the tidings. And the swift messenger from\\nthy company joined himself unto me, the henchman, who was\\nthe first to tell the news to thy mother. Yet this, too, I\\nknow, if thou wouldest hear; for I beheld it with mine\\neyes. Already had I come in my faring above the city, where\\nis the hill Hermaean, when I marked a swift ship entering\\nour haven, and many men there were in her, and she was\\nladen with shields and two-headed spears, and methought\\nthey were the wooers, but I know not at all.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and the mighty prince Telemachus smiled, and\\nglanced at his father, while he shunned the eye of the\\nswineherd.\\n\\nNow when they had ceased from the work and got supper\\nready, they fell to feasting, and their hearts lacked not\\nought of the equal banquet. But when they had put from them\\nthe desire of meat and drink, they bethought them of rest,\\nand took the boon of sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XVII\\n\\n  Telemachus relates to his mother what he had heard at Pylos\\n  and Sparta.\\n\\nSo soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, then\\nTelemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, bound beneath\\nhis feet his goodly sandals, and took up his mighty spear\\nthat fitted his grasp, to make for the city; and he spake\\nto his swineherd, saying:\\n\\n\\'Verily, father, I am bound for the city, that my mother\\nmay see me, for methinks that she will not cease from\\ngrievous wailing and tearful lament, until she beholds my\\nvery face. But this command I give thee: Lead this\\nstranger, the hapless one, to the city, that there he may\\nbeg his meat, and whoso chooses will give him a morsel of\\nbread and a cup of water. As for myself, I can in no wise\\nsuffer every guest who comes to me, so afflicted am I in\\nspirit. But if the stranger be sore angered hereat, the\\nmore grievous will it be for himself; howbeit I for one\\nlove to speak the truth.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: \\'I too,\\nmy friend, have no great liking to be left behind here. It\\nis better that a beggar should beg his meat in the town\\nthan in the fields, and whoso chooses will give it me. For\\nI am not now of an age to abide at the steading, and to\\nobey in all things the word of the master. Nay go, and this\\nman that thou biddest will lead me, so soon as I shall be\\nwarmed with the fire, and the sun waxes hot. For woefully\\npoor are these garments of mine, and I fear lest the hoar\\nfrost of the dawn overcome me; moreover ye say the city is\\nfar away.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and Telemachus passed out through the\\nsteading, stepping forth at a quick pace, and was sowing\\nthe seeds of evil for the wooers. Now when he was come to\\nthe fair-lying house, he set his spear against the tall\\npillar and leaned it there, and himself went in and crossed\\nthe threshold of stone.\\n\\nAnd the nurse Eurycleia saw him far before the rest, as she\\nwas strewing skin coverlets upon the carven chairs, and\\nstraightway she drew near him, weeping, and all the other\\nmaidens of Odysseus, of the hardy heart, were gathered\\nabout him, and kissed him lovingly on the head and\\nshoulders. Now wise Penelope came forth from her chamber,\\nlike Artemis or golden Aphrodite, and cast her arms about\\nher dear son, and fell a weeping, and kissed his face and\\nboth his beautiful eyes, and wept aloud, and spake to him\\nwinged words:\\n\\n\\'Thou art come, Telemachus, a sweet light in the dark;\\nmethought I should see thee never again, after thou hadst\\ngone in thy ship to Pylos, secretly and without my will, to\\nseek tidings of thy dear father. Come now, tell me, what\\nsight thou didst get of him?\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Telemachus answered her, saying: \\'Mother mine,\\nwake not wailing in my soul, nor stir the heart within the\\nbreast of me, that have but now fled from utter death. Nay,\\nbut wash thee in water, and take to thee fresh raiment, and\\ngo aloft to thine upper chamber with the women thy\\nhandmaids, and vow to all the gods an acceptable sacrifice\\nof hecatombs, if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of\\nrequital be made. But I will go to the assembly-place to\\nbid a stranger to our house, one that accompanied me as I\\ncame hither from Pylos. I sent him forward with my godlike\\ncompany, and commanded Piraeus to lead him home, and to\\ntake heed to treat him lovingly and with worship till I\\nshould come.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and wingless her speech remained. And she\\nwashed her in water, and took to her fresh raiment, and\\nvowed to all the gods an acceptable sacrifice of hecatombs,\\nif haply Zeus might grant that deeds of requital should be\\nmade.\\n\\nNow Telemachus went out through the hall with the spear in\\nhis hand: and two swift hounds bare him company. And Athene\\nshed on him a wondrous grace, and all the people marvelled\\nat him as he came. And the lordly wooers gathered about him\\nwith fair words on their lips, but brooding evil in the\\ndeep of their heart. Then he avoided the great press of the\\nwooers, but where Mentor sat, and Antiphus, and\\nHalitherses, who were friends of his house from of old,\\nthere he went and sat down; and they asked him of all his\\nadventures. Then Piraeus, the famed spearsman, drew nigh,\\nleading the stranger to the assembly-place by the way of\\nthe town; and Telemachus kept not aloof from him long, but\\nwent up to him.\\n\\nThen Piraeus first spake to him, saying: \\'Bestir the women\\nstraightway to go to my house, that I may send thee the\\ngifts that Menelaus gave thee.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Piraeus, we\\nknow not how these matters will fall out. If the lordly\\nwooers shall slay me by guile in the halls, and divide\\namong them the heritage of my father, then I should wish\\nthee to keep and enjoy the gifts thyself, rather than any\\nof these. But if I shall sow the seeds of death and fate\\nfor the wooers, then gladly bring me to the house the gifts\\nthat I will gladly take.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he led the travel-worn stranger to the house. Now\\nwhen they came to the fair-lying palace, they laid aside\\ntheir mantles on the chairs and high seats, and went to the\\npolished baths, and bathed them. So when the maidens had\\nbathed them and anointed them with olive oil, and cast\\nabout them thick mantles and doublets, they came forth from\\nthe baths, and sat upon the seats. Then the handmaid bare\\nwater for the hands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured it\\nforth over a silver basin to wash withal, and drew to their\\nside a polished table. And the grave dame bare wheaten\\nbread, and set it by them, and laid on the board many\\ndainties, giving freely of such things as she had by her.\\nAnd the mother of Telemachus sat over against him by the\\npillar of the hall, leaning against a chair, and spinning\\nthe slender threads from the yarn. And they stretched forth\\ntheir hands upon the good cheer set before them. Now when\\nthey had put from them the desire of meat and drink, the\\nwise Penelope first spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, verily I will go up to my upper chamber, and\\nlay me in my bed, the place of my groanings, that is ever\\nwatered by my tears, since the day that Odysseus departed\\nwith the sons of Atreus for Ilios. Yet thou hadst no care\\nto tell me clearly, before the lordly wooers came to this\\nhouse, concerning the returning of thy father, if haply\\nthou hast heard thereof.\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Telemachus answered her, saying: \\'Yea now, mother,\\nI will tell thee all the truth. We went to Pylos and to\\nNestor, the shepherd of the people, and he received me in\\nhis lofty house, and was diligent to entreat me lovingly,\\nas a father might his son that had but newly come from\\nstrange lands after many years; even so diligently he cared\\nfor me with his renowned sons. Yet he said that he had\\nheard no word from any man on earth concerning Odysseus, of\\nthe hardy heart, whether alive or dead. But he sent me\\nforward on my way with horses and a chariot, well compact,\\nto Menelaus, son of Atreus, spearman renowned. There I saw\\nArgive Helen, for whose sake the Argives and Trojans bore\\nmuch travail by the gods\\' designs. Then straightway\\nMenelaus, of the loud war-cry, asked me on what quest I had\\ncome to goodly Lacedaemon. And I told him all the truth.\\nThen he made answer, and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Out upon them, for truly in the bed of a brave-hearted\\nman were they minded to lie, very cravens as they are! Even\\nas when a hind hath couched her newborn fawns unweaned in a\\nstrong lion\\'s lair, and searcheth out the mountain-knees\\nand grassy hollows, seeking pasture; and afterward the lion\\ncometh back to his bed, and sendeth forth unsightly death\\nupon that pair, even so shall Odysseus send forth unsightly\\ndeath upon the wooers. Would to our father Zeus, and\\nAthene, and Apollo, would that in such might as when of old\\nin stablished Lesbos he rose up in strife and wrestled with\\nPhilomeleides, and threw him mightily, and all the Achaeans\\nrejoiced; would that in such strength Odysseus might\\nconsort with the wooers; then should they all have swift\\nfate and bitter wedlock! But for that whereof thou askest\\nand entreatest me, be sure I will not swerve from the truth\\nin aught that I say, nor deceive thee; but of all that the\\nancient one of the sea, whose speech is sooth, declared to\\nme, not a word will I hide or keep from thee. He said that\\nhe saw Odysseus in an island, suffering strong pains in the\\nhalls of the nymph Calypso, who holds him there perforce;\\nso that he may not come to his own country, for he has by\\nhim no ships with oars, and no companions to send him on\\nhis way over the broad back of the sea.\" So spake Menelaus,\\nson of Atreus, spearsman renowned. Then having fulfilled\\nall, I set out for home, and the deathless gods gave me a\\nfair wind, and brought me swiftly to mine own dear\\ncountry.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and stirred her heart within her breast. And\\nnext the godlike Theoclymenus spake among them:\\n\\n\\'O wife revered of Odysseus, son of Laertes, verily he hath\\nno clear knowledge; but my word do thou mark, for I will\\nprophesy to thee most truly and hide nought. Now Zeus be\\nwitness before any god, and this hospitable board and this\\nhearth of noble Odysseus, whereunto I am come, that\\nOdysseus is even now of a surety in his own country,\\nresting or faring, learning of these evil deeds, and sowing\\nthe seeds of evil for all the wooers. So clear was the omen\\nof the bird that I saw as I sat on the decked ship, and I\\nproclaimed it to Telemachus.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him, saying: \\'Ah, stranger,\\nwould that this thy word may be accomplished! Soon\\nshouldest thou be aware of kindness and of many a gift at\\nmy hands, so that whoso met with thee would call thee\\nblessed.\\'\\n\\nThus they spake one to the other. But the wooers meantime\\nwere before the palace of Odysseus, taking their pleasure\\nin casting of weights and of spears on a levelled place, as\\nheretofore, in their insolence. But when it was now the\\nhour for supper, and the flocks came home from the fields\\nall around, and the men led them whose custom it was, then\\nMedon, who of all the henchmen was most to their mind, and\\nwas ever with them at the feast, spake to them, saying:\\n\\n\\'Noble youths, now that ye have had sport to your hearts\\'\\ncontent, get you into the house, that we may make ready a\\nfeast; for truly it is no bad thing to take meat in\\nseason.\\'\\n\\nEven so he spake, and they rose up and departed, and were\\nobedient to his word. Now when they were come into the\\nfair-lying house, they laid aside their mantles on the\\nchairs and high seats, and they sacrificed great sheep and\\nstout goats, yea, and the fatlings of the boars and an\\nheifer of the herd, and got ready the feast.\\n\\nNow all this while Odysseus and the goodly swineherd were\\nbestirring them to go from the field to the city; and the\\nswineherd, a master of men, spake first saying:\\n\\n\\'Well, my friend, forasmuch as I see thou art eager to be\\ngoing to the city to-day, even as my master gave command;--\\nthough myself I would well that thou shouldest be left here\\nto keep the steading, but I hold him in reverence and fear,\\nlest he chide me afterwards, and grievous are the rebukes\\nof masters--come then, let us go on our way, for lo, the\\nday is far spent, and soon wilt thou find it colder toward\\nevening.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: \\'I\\nmark, I heed: all this thou speakest to one with\\nunderstanding. But let us be going, and be thou my guide\\nwithal to the end. And if thou hast anywhere a staff ready\\ncut, give it me to lean upon, for truly ye said that\\nslippery was the way.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he cast about his shoulders a mean scrip, all\\ntattered, and a cord withal to hang it, and Eumaeus gave\\nhim a staff to his mind. So these twain went on their way,\\nand the dogs and the herdsmen stayed behind to guard the\\nsteading. And the swineherd led his lord to the city in the\\nguise of a beggar, a wretched man and an old, leaning on a\\nstaff; and sorry was the raiment wherewith he was clothed\\nupon. But as they fared along the rugged path they drew\\nnear to the town, and came to the fair flowing spring, with\\na basin fashioned, whence the people of the city drew\\nwater. This well Ithacus and Neritus and Polyctor had\\nbuilded. And around it was a thicket of alders that grow by\\nthe waters, all circlewise, and down the cold stream fell\\nfrom a rock on high, and above was reared an altar to the\\nNymphs, whereat all wayfarers made offering. In that place\\nMelanthius, son of Dolius, met them, leading his goats to\\nfeast the wooers, the best goats that were in all the\\nherds; and two herdsmen bare him company. Now when he saw\\nthem he reviled them, and spake and hailed them, in\\nterrible and evil fashion, and stirred the heart of\\nOdysseus, saying:\\n\\n\\'Now in very truth the vile is leading the vile, for god\\nbrings ever like to like! Say, whither art thou leading\\nthis glutton,--thou wretched swineherd,--this plaguy\\nbeggar, a kill-joy of the feast? He is one to stand about\\nand rub his shoulders against many doorposts, begging for\\nscraps of meat, not for swords or cauldrons. If thou\\nwouldst give me the fellow to watch my steading and sweep\\nout the stalls, and carry fresh fodder to the kids, then he\\nmight drink whey and get him a stout thigh. Howbeit, since\\nhe is practised only in evil, he will not care to betake\\nhim to the labour of the farm, but rather chooses to go\\nlouting through the land asking alms to fill his insatiate\\nbelly. But now I will speak out and my word shall surely be\\naccomplished. If ever he fares to the house of divine\\nOdysseus, many a stool that men\\'s hands hurl shall fly\\nabout his head, and break upon his ribs, {*} as they pelt\\nhim through the house.\\'\\n\\n{* Reading [Greek]}\\n\\nTherewith, as he went past, he kicked Odysseus on the hip,\\nin his witlessness, yet he drave him not from the path, but\\nhe abode steadfast. And Odysseus pondered whether he should\\nrush upon him and take away his life with the staff, or\\nlift him in his grasp {*} and smite his head to the earth.\\nYet he hardened his heart to endure and refrained himself.\\nAnd the swineherd looked at the other and rebuked him, and\\nlifting up his hands prayed aloud:\\n\\n{* [Greek] is perhaps best taken as an adverb in [Greek]\\nformed from [Greek], though some letters of the word are\\nstill left obscure. Most modern commentators, however,\\nderive it from [Greek] and [Greek] \\'near the ground; hence,\\nin this context, \\'lift him by the feet.\\'}\\n\\n\\'Nymphs of the well-water, daughters of Zeus, if ever\\nOdysseus burned on your altars pieces of the thighs of rams\\nor kids, in their covering of rich fat, fulfil for me this\\nwish:--oh that he, even he, may come home, and that some\\ngod may bring him! Then would he scatter all thy bravery,\\nwhich now thou flauntest insolently, wandering ever about\\nthe city, while evil shepherds destroy the flock.\\'\\n\\nThen Melanthius, the goatherd, answered: \\'Lo now, what a\\nword has this evil-witted dog been saying! Some day I will\\ntake him in a black decked ship far from Ithaca, that he\\nmay bring me in much livelihood. Would God that Apollo, of\\nthe silver bow, might smite Telemachus to-day in the halls,\\nor that he might fall before the wooers, so surely as for\\nOdysseus the day of returning has in a far land gone by!\\'\\n\\nSo he spake and left them there as they walked slowly on.\\nBut Melanthius stepped forth, and came very speedily to the\\nhouse of the prince, and straightway he went in and sat\\ndown among the wooers, over against Eurymachus, who chiefly\\nshowed him kindness. And they that ministered set by him a\\nportion of flesh, and the grave dame brought wheaten bread\\nand set it by him to eat. Now Odysseus and the goodly\\nswineherd drew near and stood by, and the sound of the\\nhollow lyre rang around them, for Phemius was lifting up\\nhis voice amid the company in song, and Odysseus caught the\\nswineherd by the hand, and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Eumaeus, verily this is the fair house of Odysseus, and\\nright easily might it be known and marked even among many.\\nThere is building beyond building, and the court of the\\nhouse is cunningly wrought with a wall and battlements, and\\nwell-fenced are the folding doors; no man may hold it in\\ndisdain. And I see that many men keep revel within, for the\\nsavour of the fat rises upward, {*} and the voice of the\\nlyre is heard there, which the gods have made to be the\\nmate of the feast.\\'\\n\\n{* Reading [Greek]}\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: \\'Easily\\nthou knowest it, for indeed thou never lackest\\nunderstanding. But come, let us advise us, how things shall\\nfall out here. Either do thou go first within the\\nfair-lying halls, and join the company of the wooers, so\\nwill I remain here, or if thou wilt, abide here, and I will\\ngo before thy face, and tarry not long, lest one see thee\\nwithout, and hurl at thee or strike thee. Look well to\\nthis, I bid thee.\\'\\n\\nThen the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him, saying: \\'I\\nmark, I heed, all this thou speakest to one with\\nunderstanding. Do thou then go before me, and I will remain\\nhere, for well I know what it is to be smitten and hurled\\nat. My heart is full of hardiness, for much evil have I\\nsuffered in perils of waves and war; let this be added to\\nthe tale of those. But a ravening belly may none conceal, a\\nthing accursed, that works much ill for men. For this cause\\ntoo the benched ships are furnished, that bear mischief to\\nfoemen over the unharvested seas.\\'\\n\\nThus they spake one to the other. And lo, a hound raised up\\nhis head and pricked his ears, even where he lay, Argos,\\nthe hound of Odysseus, of the hardy heart, which of old\\nhimself had bred, but had got no joy of him, for ere that,\\nhe went to sacred Ilios. Now in time past the young men\\nused to lead the hound against wild goats and deer and\\nhares; but as then, despised he lay (his master being afar)\\nin the deep dung of mules and kine, whereof an ample bed\\nwas spread before the doors, till the thralls of Odysseus\\nshould carry it away to dung therewith his wide demesne.\\nThere lay the dog Argos, full of vermin. Yet even now when\\nhe was ware of Odysseus standing by, he wagged his tail and\\ndropped both his ears, but nearer to his master he had not\\nnow the strength to draw. But Odysseus looked aside and\\nwiped away a tear that he easily hid from Eumaeus, and\\nstraightway he asked him, saying:\\n\\n\\'Eumaeus, verily this is a great marvel, this hound lying\\nhere in the dung. Truly he is goodly of growth, but I know\\nnot certainly if he have speed with this beauty, or if he\\nbe comely only, like as are men\\'s trencher dogs that their\\nlords keep for the pleasure of the eye.\\'\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: \\'In very\\ntruth this is the dog of a man that has died in a far land.\\nIf he were what once he was in limb and in the feats of the\\nchase, when Odysseus left him to go to Troy, soon wouldst\\nthou marvel at the sight of his swiftness and his strength.\\nThere was no beast that could flee from him in the deep\\nplaces of the wood, when he was in pursuit; for even on a\\ntrack he was the keenest hound. But now he is holden in an\\nevil case, and his lord hath perished far from his own\\ncountry, and the careless women take no charge of him. Nay,\\nthralls are no more inclined to honest service when their\\nmasters have lost the dominion, for Zeus, of the far-borne\\nvoice, takes away the half of a man\\'s virtue, when the day\\nof slavery comes upon him.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he passed within the fair-lying house, and went\\nstraight to the hall, to the company of the proud wooers.\\nBut upon Argos came the fate of black death even in the\\nhour that he beheld Odysseus again, in the twentieth year.\\n\\nNow godlike Telemachus was far the first to behold the\\nswineherd as he came into the hall, and straightway then he\\nbeckoned and called him to his side. So Eumaeus looked\\nabout and took a settle that lay by him, where the carver\\nwas wont to sit dividing much flesh among the wooers that\\nwere feasting in the house. This seat he carried and set by\\nthe table of Telemachus over against him, and there sat\\ndown himself. And the henchman took a mess and served it\\nhim, and wheaten bread out of the basket.\\n\\nAnd close behind him Odysseus entered the house in the\\nguise of a beggar, a wretched man and an old, leaning on\\nhis staff, and clothed on with sorry raiment. And he sat\\ndown on the ashen threshold within the doorway, leaning\\nagainst a pillar of cypress wood, which the carpenter on a\\ntime had deftly planed, and thereon made straight the line.\\nAnd Telemachus called the swineherd to him, and took a\\nwhole loaf out of the fair basket, and of flesh so much as\\nhis hands could hold in their grasp, saying:\\n\\n\\'Take and give this to the stranger, and bid him go about\\nand beg himself of all the wooers in their turn, for shame\\nis an ill mate of a needy man.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and the swineherd went when he heard that\\nsaying, and stood by and spake to him winged words:\\n\\n\\'Stranger, Telemachus gives thee these and bids thee go\\nabout and beg of all the wooers in their turn, for, he\\nsays, \"shame ill becomes a beggar man.\"\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered him and said: \\'King\\nZeus, grant me that Telemachus may be happy among men, and\\nmay he have all his heart\\'s desire!\\'\\n\\nTherewith he took the gift in both hands, and set it there\\nbefore his feet on his unsightly scrip. Then he ate meat so\\nlong as the minstrel was singing in the halls. When he had\\ndone supper, and the divine minstrel was ending his song,\\nthen the wooers raised a clamour through the halls; but\\nAthene stood by Odysseus, son of Laertes, and moved him to\\ngo gathering morsels of bread among the wooers, and learn\\nwhich were righteous and which unjust. Yet not even so was\\nshe fated to redeem one man of them from an evil doom. So\\nhe set out, beginning on the right, to ask of each man,\\nstretching out his hand on every side, as though he were a\\nbeggar from of old. And they in pity gave him somewhat, and\\nwere amazed at the man, asking one another who he was and\\nwhence he came?\\n\\nThen Melanthius, the goatherd, spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Listen, ye wooers of the renowned queen, concerning this\\nstranger, for verily I have seen him before. The swineherd\\ntruly was his guide hither, but of him I have no certain\\nknowledge, whence he avows him to be born.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, but Antinous rebuked the swineherd, saying:\\n\\'Oh notorious swineherd, wherefore, I pray thee, didst thou\\nbring this man to the city? Have we not vagrants enough\\nbesides, plaguy beggars, kill-joys of the feast? Dost thou\\ncount it a light thing that they assemble here and devour\\nthe living of thy master, but thou must needs {*} call in\\nthis man too?\\'\\n\\n{* [Greek] can hardly have a local meaning here. If\\nretained, it must be nearly equivalent to [Greek], \\'it\\nseems,\\' with a touch of irony. Cf. i.348. The v. 1. [Greek]\\nis a simpler reading, but by no means certain.}\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: \\'Antinous,\\nno fair words are these of thine, noble though thou art.\\nFor who ever himself seeks out and bids to the feast a\\nstranger from afar, save only one of those that are\\ncraftsmen of the people, a prophet or a healer of ills, or\\na shipwright or even a godlike minstrel, who can delight\\nall with his song? Nay, these are the men that are welcome\\nover all the wide earth. But none would call a beggar to\\nthe banquet, to waste his substance. But thou art ever hard\\nabove all the other wooers to the servants of Odysseus,\\nand, beyond all, to me; but behold, I care not, so long as\\nmy mistress, the constant Penelope, lives in the halls and\\ngodlike Telemachus.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Be silent,\\nanswer him not, I pray thee, with many words, for Antinous\\nis wont ever to chide us shamefully with bitter speech,\\nyea, and urges the others thereto.\\'\\n\\nTherewithal he spake winged words to Antinous: \\'Antinous,\\nverily thou hast a good care for me, as it were a father\\nfor his son, thou that biddest me drive our guest from the\\nhall with a harsh command. God forbid that such a thing\\nshould be! Take somewhat and give it him: lo, I grudge it\\nnot; nay, I charge thee to do it. And herein regard not my\\nmother, nor any of the thralls that are in the house of\\ndivine Odysseus. Nay, but thou hast no such thought in thy\\nheart, for thou art far more fain to eat thyself than to\\ngive to another.\\'\\n\\nThen Antinous answered him and spake, saying: \\'Telemachus,\\nproud of speech, and unrestrained in fury, what word hast\\nthou spoken? If all the wooers should vouchsafe him as much\\nas I, this house would keep him far enough aloof even for\\nthree months\\' space.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and seized the footstool whereon he rested his\\nsleek feet as he sat at the feast, and showed it from\\nbeneath the table where it lay. But all the others gave\\nsomewhat and filled the wallet with bread and flesh; yea,\\nand even now, Odysseus as he returned to the threshold, was\\nlike to escape scot free, making trial of the Achaeans, but\\nhe halted by Antinous, and spake to him, saying:\\n\\n\\'Friend, give me somewhat; for methinks thou art not the\\nbasest of the Achaeans, but the best man of them all, for\\nthou art like a king. Wherefore thou shouldest give me a\\nportion of bread, and that a better than the others; so\\nwould I make thee renowned over all the wide earth. For I\\ntoo, once had a house of mine own among men, a rich man\\nwith a wealthy house, and many a time would I give to a\\nwanderer, what manner of man soever he might be, and in\\nwhatsoever need he came. And I had thralls out of number,\\nand all else in plenty, wherewith folk live well and have a\\nname for riches. But Zeus, the son of Cronos, made me\\ndesolate of all,--for surely it was his will,--who sent me\\nwith wandering sea-robbers to go to Egypt, a far road, to\\nmy ruin. And in the river Aegyptus I stayed my curved\\nships. Then verily I bade my loved companions to abide\\nthere by the ships, and to guard the ship, and I sent forth\\nscouts to range the points of outlook. Now they gave place\\nto wantonness, being the fools of their own force, and soon\\nthey fell to wasting the fields of the Egyptians, exceeding\\nfair, and carried away their wives and infant children, and\\nslew the men. And the cry came quickly to the city, and the\\npeople heard the shout and came forth at the breaking of\\nthe day; and all the plain was filled with footmen and\\nhorsemen and with the glitter of bronze. And Zeus, whose\\njoy is in the thunder, sent an evil panic upon my company,\\nand none durst stand and face the foe: for danger\\nencompassed us on every side. There they slew many of us\\nwith the edge of the sword, and others they led up with\\nthem alive to work for them perforce. But they gave me to a\\nfriend who met them, to take to Cyprus, even to Dmetor son\\nof Iasus, who ruled mightily over Cyprus; and thence,\\nbehold, am I now come hither in sore distress.\\'\\n\\nThen Antinous answered, and spake, saying: \\'What god hath\\nbrought this plague hither to trouble the feast? Stand\\nforth thus in the midst, away from my table, lest thou come\\nsoon to a bitter Egypt and a sad Cyprus; for a bold beggar\\nart thou and a shameless. Thou standest by all in turn and\\nrecklessly they give to thee, for they hold not their hand\\nnor feel any ruth in giving freely of others\\' goods, for\\nthat each man has plenty by him.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels drew back and answered him:\\n\\'Lo now, I see thou hast not wisdom with thy beauty! From\\nout of thine own house thou wouldest not give even so much\\nas a grain of salt to thy suppliant, thou who now even at\\nanother\\'s board dost sit, and canst not find it in thy\\nheart to take of the bread and give it me, where there is\\nplenty to thy hand.\\'\\n\\nHe spake, and Antinous was mightily angered at heart, and\\nlooked fiercely on him and spake winged words:\\n\\n\\'Henceforth, methinks, thou shalt not get thee out with\\nhonour from the hall, seeing thou dost even rail upon me.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he caught up the foot-stool and smote Odysseus at\\nthe base of the right shoulder by the back. But he stood\\nfirm as a rock, nor reeled he beneath the blow of Antinous,\\nbut shook his head in silence, brooding evil in the deep of\\nhis heart. Then he went back to the threshold, and sat him\\nthere, and laid down his well-filled scrip, and spake among\\nthe wooers:\\n\\n\\'Hear me, ye wooers of the renowned queen, and I will say\\nwhat my spirit within me bids me. Verily there is neither\\npain nor grief of heart, when a man is smitten in battle\\nfighting for his own possessions, whether cattle or white\\nsheep. But now Antinous hath stricken me for my wretched\\nbelly\\'s sake, a thing accursed, that works much ill for\\nmen. Ah, if indeed there be gods and Avengers of beggars,\\nmay the issues of death come upon Antinous before his\\nwedding!\\'\\n\\nThen Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: \\'Sit and eat\\nthy meat in quiet, stranger, or get thee elsewhere, lest\\nthe young men drag thee by hand or foot through the house\\nfor thy evil words, and strip all thy flesh from off thee.\\'\\n\\nEven so he spake, and they were all exceeding wroth at his\\nword. And on this wise would one of the lordly young men\\nspeak:\\n\\n\\'Antinous, thou didst ill to strike the hapless wanderer,\\ndoomed man that thou art,--if indeed there be a god in\\nheaven. Yea and the gods, in the likeness of strangers from\\nfar countries, put on all manner of shapes, and wander\\nthrough the cities, beholding the violence and the\\nrighteousness of men.\\'\\n\\nSo the wooers spake, but he heeded not their words. Now\\nTelemachus nursed in his heart a mighty grief at the\\nsmiting of Odysseus, yet he let no tear fall from his\\neyelids to the ground, but shook his head in silence,\\nbrooding evil in the deep of his heart.\\n\\nNow when wise Penelope heard of the stranger being smitten\\nin the halls, she spake among her maidens, saying:\\n\\n\\'Oh that Apollo, the famed archer, may so smite thee\\nthyself, Antinous!\\'\\n\\nAnd the house-dame, Eurynome, answered her, saying: \\'Oh\\nthat we might win fulfilment of our prayers! So should not\\none of these men come to the fair-throned Dawn.\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Penelope answered her: \\'Nurse, they are all\\nenemies, for they all devise evil continually, but of them\\nall Antinous is the most like to black fate. Some hapless\\nstranger is roaming about the house, begging alms of the\\nmen, as his need bids him; and all the others filled his\\nwallet and gave him somewhat, but Antinous smote him at the\\nbase of the right shoulder with a stool.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake among her maidens, sitting in her chamber,\\nwhile goodly Odysseus was at meat. Then she called to her\\nthe goodly swineherd and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Go thy way, goodly Eumaeus, and bid the stranger come\\nhither, that I may speak him a word of greeting, and ask\\nhim if haply he has heard tidings of Odysseus of the hardy\\nheart, or seen him with his eyes; for he seems like one\\nthat has wandered far.\\'\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: \\'Queen, oh\\nthat the Achaeans would hold their peace! so would he charm\\nthy very heart, such things doth he say. For I kept him\\nthree nights and three days I held him in the steading, for\\nto me he came first when he fled from the ship, yet he had\\nnot made an end of the tale of his affliction. Even as when\\na man gazes on a singer, whom the gods have taught to sing\\nwords of yearning joy to mortals, and they have a ceaseless\\ndesire to hear him, so long as he will sing; even so he\\ncharmed me, sitting by me in the halls. He says that he is\\na friend of Odysseus and of his house, one that dwells in\\nCrete, where is the race of Minos. Thence he has come\\nhither even now, with sorrow by the way, onward and yet\\nonward wandering; and he stands to it that he has heard\\ntidings of Odysseus nigh at hand and yet alive in the fat\\nland of the men of Thesprotia; and he is bringing many\\ntreasures to his home.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him, saying: \\'Go, call him\\nhither, that he may speak to me face to face. But let these\\nmen sit in the doorway and take their pleasure, or even\\nhere in the house, since their heart is glad. For their own\\nwealth lies unspoiled at home, bread and sweet wine, and\\nthereon do their servants feed. But they resorting to our\\nhouse day by day sacrifice oxen and sheep and fat goats,\\nand keep revel and drink the dark wine recklessly; and, lo,\\nour great wealth is wasted, for there is no man now alive,\\nsuch as Odysseus was, to keep ruin from the house. Oh, if\\nOdysseus might come again to his own country; soon would he\\nand his son avenge the violence of these men!\\'\\n\\nEven so she spake, and Telemachus sneezed loudly, and\\naround the roof rang wondrously. And Penelope laughed, and\\nstraightway spake to Eumaeus winged words:\\n\\n\\'Go, call me the stranger, even so, into my presence. Dost\\nthou not mark how my son has sneezed a blessing on all my\\nwords? Wherefore no half-wrought doom shall befal the\\nwooers every one, nor shall any avoid death and the fates.\\nYet another thing will I say, and do thou ponder it in thy\\nheart. If I shall find that he himself speaks nought but\\ntruth, I will clothe him with a mantle and a doublet,\\ngoodly raiment.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake, and the swineherd departed when he heard that\\nsaying, and stood by the stranger and spake winged words:\\n\\n\\'Father and stranger, wise Penelope, the mother of\\nTelemachus, is calling for thee, and her mind bids her\\ninquire as touching her lord, albeit she has sorrowed much\\nalready. And if she shall find that thou dost speak nought\\nbut truth, she will clothe thee in a mantle and a doublet,\\nwhereof thou standest most in need. Moreover thou shalt beg\\nthy bread through the land and shalt fill thy belly, and\\nwhosoever will, shall give to thee.\\'\\n\\nThen the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him, saying:\\n\\'Eumaeus, soon would I tell all the truth to the daughter\\nof Icarius, wise Penelope, for well I know his story, and\\nwe have borne our travail together. But I tremble before\\nthe throng of the froward wooers, whose outrage and\\nviolence reach even to the iron heaven. For even now, as I\\nwas going through the house, when this man struck and\\npained me sore, and that for no ill deed, neither\\nTelemachus nor any other kept off the blow. Wherefore now,\\nbid Penelope tarry in the chambers, for all her eagerness,\\ntill the going down of the sun, and then let her ask me\\nconcerning her lord, as touching the day of his returning,\\nand let her give me a seat yet nearer to the fire, for\\nbehold, I have sorry raiment, and thou knowest it thyself,\\nsince I made my supplication first to thee.\\'\\n\\nEven so he spake, and the swineherd departed when he heard\\nthat saying. And as he crossed the threshold Penelope spake\\nto him:\\n\\n\\'Thou bringest him not, Eumaeus: what means the wanderer\\nhereby? Can it be that he fears some one out of measure, or\\nis he even ashamed of tarrying in the house? A shamefaced\\nman makes a bad beggar.\\'\\n\\nThen didst thou make answer, swineherd Eumaeus: \\'He speaks\\naright, and but as another would deem, in that he shuns the\\noutrage of overweening men. Rather would he have thee wait\\ntill the going down of the sun. Yea, and it is far meeter\\nfor thyself, O queen, to utter thy word to the stranger\\nalone, and to listen to his speech.\\'\\n\\nThen the wise Penelope answered: \\'Not witless is the\\nstranger; even as he deems, so it well may be. {*} For\\nthere are no mortal men, methinks, so wanton as these, and\\nnone that devise such infatuate deeds.\\'\\n\\n{* Placing at colon at [Greek], and reading [Greek] (cf.\\nxix.312).}\\n\\nSo she spake, and the goodly swineherd departed into the\\nthrong of the wooers, when he had showed her all his\\nmessage. And straightway he spake to Telemachus winged\\nwords, holding his head close to him, that the others might\\nnot hear:\\n\\n\\'Friend, I am going hence to look after thy swine and the\\nthings of the farm, thy livelihood and mine; but do thou\\ntake charge of all that is here. Yet first look to thyself\\nand take heed that no evil comes nigh thee, for many of the\\nAchaeans have ill will against us, whom may Zeus confound\\nbefore their mischief falls on us!\\'\\n\\nAnd wise Telemachus answered him, and said: \\'Even so shall\\nit be, father; and do thou get thee on thy way, when thou\\nhast supped. And in the morning come again, and bring fair\\nvictims for sacrifice. And all these matters will be a care\\nto me and to the deathless gods.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and the other sat down again on the polished\\nsettle; and when he had satisfied his heart with meat and\\ndrink, he went on his way to the swine, leaving the courts\\nand the hall full of feasters; and they were making merry\\nwith dance and song, for already it was close on eventide.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XVIII\\n\\n  The fighting at fists of Odysseus with Irus. His\\n  admonitions to Amphinomus. Penelope appears before the\\n  wooers, and draws presents from them.\\n\\nThen up came a common beggar, who was wont to beg through\\nthe town of Ithaca, one that was known among all men for\\nravening greed, for his endless eating and drinking, yet he\\nhad no force or might, though he was bulky enough to look\\non. Arnaeus was his name, for so had his good mother given\\nit him at his birth, but all the young men called him Irus,\\nbecause he ran on errands, whensoever any might bid him. So\\nnow he came, and would have driven Odysseus from his own\\nhouse, and began reviling him, and spake winged words:\\n\\n\\'Get thee hence, old man, from the doorway, lest thou be\\neven haled out soon by the foot. Seest thou not that all\\nare now giving me the wink, and bidding me drag thee forth?\\nNevertheless, I feel shame of the task. Nay get thee up,\\nlest our quarrel soon pass even to blows.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on him, and\\nspake saying: \\'Sir, neither in deed nor word do I harm\\nthee, nor do I grudge that any should give to thee, yea\\nthough it were a good handful. But this threshold will hold\\nus both, and thou hast no need to be jealous for the sake\\nof other men\\'s goods. Thou seemest to me to be a wanderer,\\neven as I am, and the gods it is that are like to give us\\ngain. Only provoke me not overmuch to buffeting, lest thou\\nanger me, and old though I be I defile thy breast and lips\\nwith blood. Thereby should I have the greater quiet\\nto-morrow, for methinks that thou shalt never again come to\\nthe hall of Odysseus, son of Laertes\\'.\\n\\nThen the beggar Irus spake unto him in anger: \\'Lo now, how\\ntrippingly and like an old cinder-wife this glutton speaks,\\non whom I will work my evil will, and smite him right and\\nleft, and drive all the teeth from his jaws to the ground,\\nlike the tusks of a swine that spoils the corn. Gird\\nthyself now, that even these men all may know our mettle in\\nfight. Nay, how shouldst thou do battle with a younger man\\nthan thou?\\'\\n\\nThus did they whet each the other\\'s rage right manfully\\nbefore the lofty doors upon the polished threshold. And the\\nmighty prince Antinous heard the twain, and sweetly he\\nlaughed out, and spake among the wooers:\\n\\n\\'Friends, never before has there been such a thing; such\\ngoodly game has a god brought to this house. The stranger\\nyonder and Irus are bidding each other to buffets. Quick,\\nlet us match them one against the other.\\'\\n\\nThen all at the word leaped up laughing, and gathered round\\nthe ragged beggars, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spake\\namong them saying: \\'Hear me, ye lordly wooers, and I will\\nsay somewhat. Here are goats\\' bellies lying at the fire,\\nthat we laid by at supper-time and filled with fat and\\nblood. Now whichsoever of the twain wins, and shows himself\\nthe better man, let him stand up and take his choice of\\nthese puddings. And further, he shall always eat at our\\nfeasts, nor will we suffer any other beggar to come among\\nus and ask for alms.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Antinous, and the saying pleased them well. Then\\nOdysseus of many counsels spake among them craftily:\\n\\n\\'Friends, an old man and foredone with travail may in no\\nwise fight with a younger. But my belly\\'s call is urgent on\\nme, that evil-worker, to the end that I may be subdued with\\nstripes. But come now, swear me all of you a strong oath,\\nso that none, for the sake of shewing a favour to Irus, may\\nstrike me a foul blow with heavy hand and subdue me by\\nviolence to my foe.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and they all swore not to strike him, as he\\nbade them. Now when they had sworn and done that oath, the\\nmighty prince Telemachus once more spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Stranger, if thy heart and lordly spirit urge thee to rid\\nthee of this fellow, then fear not any other of the\\nAchaeans, for whoso strikes thee shall have to fight with\\nmany. Thy host am I, and the princes consent with me,\\nAntinous and Eurymachus, men of wisdom both.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he and they all consented thereto. Then Odysseus\\ngirt his rags about his loins, and let his thighs be seen,\\ngoodly and great, and his broad shoulders and breast and\\nmighty arms were manifest. And Athene came nigh and made\\ngreater the limbs of the shepherd of the people. Then the\\nwooers were exceedingly amazed, and thus would one speak\\nlooking to his neighbour:\\n\\n\\'Right soon will Irus, un-Irused, have a bane of his own\\nbringing, such a thigh as that old man shows from out his\\nrags!\\'\\n\\nSo they spake, and the mind of Irus was pitifully stirred;\\nbut even so the servants girded him and led him out\\nperforce in great fear, his flesh trembling on his limbs.\\nThen Antinous chid him, and spake and hailed him:\\n\\n\\'Thou lubber, better for thee that thou wert not now, nor\\never hadst been born, if indeed thou tremblest before this\\nman, and art so terribly afraid; an old man too he is, and\\nforedone with the travail that is come upon him. But I will\\ntell thee plainly, and it shall surely be accomplished. If\\nthis man prevail against thee and prove thy master, I will\\ncast thee into a black ship, and send thee to the mainland\\nto Echetus the king, the maimer of all mankind, who will\\ncut off thy nose and ears with the pitiless steel, and draw\\nout thy vitals and give them raw to dogs to rend.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and yet greater trembling gat hold of the\\nlimbs of Irus, and they led him into the ring, and the\\ntwain put up their hands. Then the steadfast goodly\\nOdysseus mused in himself whether he should smite him in\\nsuch wise that his life should leave his body, even there\\nwhere he fell, or whether he should strike him lightly, and\\nstretch him on the earth. And as he thought thereon, this\\nseemed to him the better way, to strike lightly, that the\\nAchaeans might not take note of him, who he was. Then the\\ntwain put up their hands, and Irus struck at the right\\nshoulder, but the other smote him on his neck beneath the\\near, and crushed in the bones, and straightway the red\\nblood gushed up through his mouth, and with a moan he fell\\nin the dust, and drave together his teeth as he kicked the\\nground. But the proud wooers threw up their hands, and died\\noutright for laughter. Then Odysseus seized him by the\\nfoot, and dragged him forth through the doorway, till he\\ncame to the courtyard and the gates of the gallery, and he\\nset him down and rested him against the courtyard wall, and\\nput his staff in his hands, and uttering his voice spake to\\nhim winged words:\\n\\n\\'Sit thou there now, and scare off swine and dogs, and let\\nnot such an one as thou be lord over strangers and beggars,\\npitiful as thou art, lest haply some worse thing befal\\nthee.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and cast about his shoulders his mean scrip\\nall tattered, and the cord therewith to hang it, and he gat\\nhim back to the threshold, and sat him down there again.\\nNow the wooers went within laughing sweetly, and greeted\\nhim, saying:\\n\\n\\'May Zeus, stranger, and all the other deathless gods give\\nthee thy dearest wish, even all thy heart\\'s desire, seeing\\nthat thou hast made that insatiate one to cease from his\\nbegging in the land! Soon will we take him over to the\\nmainland, to Echetus the king, the maimer of all mankind.\\'\\n\\nSo they spake, and goodly Odysseus rejoiced in the omen of\\nthe words. And Antinous set by him the great pudding,\\nstuffed with fat and blood, and Amphinomus took up two\\nloaves from the basket, and set them by him and pledged him\\nin a golden cup, and spake saying:\\n\\n\\'Father and stranger, hail! may happiness be thine in the\\ntime to come; but as now, thou art fast holden in many\\nsorrows.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying:\\n\\'Amphinomus, verily thou seemest to me a prudent man\\nenough; for such too was the father of whom thou art\\nsprung, for I have heard the fair fame of him, how that\\nNisus of Dulichium was a good man and a rich, and his son\\nthey say thou art, and thou seemest a man of understanding.\\nWherefore I will tell thee, and do thou mark and listen to\\nme. Nought feebler doth the earth nurture than man, of all\\nthe creatures that breathe and move upon the face of the\\nearth. Lo, he thinks that he shall never suffer evil in\\ntime to come, while the gods give him happiness, and his\\nlimbs move lightly. But when again the blessed gods have\\nwrought for him sorrow, even so he bears it, as he must,\\nwith a steadfast heart. For the spirit of men upon the\\nearth is even as their day, that comes upon them from the\\nfather of gods and men. Yea, and I too once was like to\\nhave been prosperous among men, but many an infatuate deed\\nI did, giving place to mine own hardihood and strength, and\\ntrusting to my father and my brethren. Wherefore let no man\\nfor ever be lawless any more, but keep quietly the gifts of\\nthe gods, whatsoever they may give. Such infatuate deeds do\\nI see the wooers devising, as they waste the wealth, and\\nhold in no regard the wife of a man, who, methinks, will\\nnot much longer be far from his friends and his own land;\\nnay he is very near. But for thee, may some god withdraw\\nthee hence to thy home, and mayst thou not meet him in the\\nday when he returns to his own dear country! For not\\nwithout blood, as I deem, will they be sundered, the wooers\\nand Odysseus, when once he shall have come beneath his own\\nroof.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and poured an offering and then drank of the\\nhoney-sweet wine, and again set the cup in the hands of the\\narrayer of the people. But the other went back through the\\nhall, sad at heart and bowing his head; for verily his soul\\nboded evil. Yet even so he avoided not his fate, for Athene\\nhad bound him likewise to be slain outright at the hands\\nand by the spear of Telemachus. So he sat down again on the\\nhigh seat whence he had arisen.\\n\\nNow the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put it into the heart of\\nthe daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, to show herself to\\nthe wooers, that she might make their heart all flutter\\nwith hope, and that she might win yet more worship from her\\nlord and her son than heretofore. To she laughed an idle\\nlaugh, and spake to the nurse, and hailed her, saying:\\n\\n\\'Eurynome, my heart yearns, though before I had no such\\ndesire, to show myself to the wooers, hateful as they are.\\nI would also say a word to my son, that will be for his\\nweal, namely, that he should not for ever consort with the\\nproud wooers, who speak friendly with their lips, but\\nimagine evil in the latter end.\\'\\n\\nThen the housewife, Eurynome, spake to her saying: \\'Yea my\\nchild, all this thou hast spoken as is meet. Go then, and\\ndeclare thy word to thy son and hide it not, but first wash\\nthee and anoint thy face, and go not as thou art with thy\\ncheeks all stained with tears. Go, for it is little good to\\nsorrow always, and never cease. And lo, thy son is now of\\nan age to hear thee, he whom thou hast above all things\\nprayed the gods that thou mightest see with a beard upon\\nhis chin.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered her, saying: \\'Eurynome, speak\\nnot thus comfortably to me, for all thy love, bidding me to\\nwash and be anointed with ointment. For the gods that keep\\nOlympus destroyed my bloom, since the day that he departed\\nin the hollow ships. But bid Autonoe and Hippodameia come\\nto me, to stand by my side in the halls. Alone I will not\\ngo among men, for I am ashamed.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake, and the old woman passed through the chamber\\nto tell the maidens, and hasten their coming.\\n\\nThereon the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another thought.\\nShe shed a sweet slumber over the daughter of Icarius, who\\nsank back in sleep, and all her joints were loosened as she\\nlay in the chair, and the fair goddess the while was giving\\nher gifts immortal, that all the Achaeans might marvel at\\nher. Her fair face first she steeped with beauty\\nimperishable, such as that wherewith the crowned Cytherea\\nis anointed, when she goes to the lovely dances of the\\nGraces. And she made her taller and greater to behold, and\\nmade her whiter than new-sawn ivory. Now when she had\\nwrought thus, that fair goddess departed, and the\\nwhite-armed handmaidens came forth from the chamber and\\ndrew nigh with a sound of voices. Then sweet sleep left\\nhold of Penelope, and she rubbed her cheeks with her hands,\\nand said:\\n\\n\\'Surely soft slumber wrapped me round, most wretched though\\nI be. Oh! that pure Artemis would give me so soft a death\\neven now, that I might no more waste my life in sorrow of\\nheart, and longing for the manifold excellence of my dear\\nlord, for that he was foremost of the Achaeans.\\'\\n\\nWith this word she went down from the shining upper\\nchamber, not alone, for two handmaidens likewise bare her\\ncompany. But when the fair lady had now come to the wooers,\\nshe stood by the pillar of the well-builded roof, holding\\nher glistening tire before her face, and on either side of\\nher stood a faithful handmaid. And straightway the knees of\\nthe wooers were loosened, and their hearts were enchanted\\nwith love, and each one uttered a prayer that he might be\\nher bed-fellow. But she spake to Telemachus, her dear son:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable\\nas they were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a\\nyet quicker and more crafty wit, but now that thou art\\ngreat of growth, and art come to the measure of manhood,\\nand a stranger looking to thy stature and thy beauty might\\nsay that thou must be some rich man\\'s son, thy mind and thy\\nthoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner\\nof deed has been done in these halls, in that thou hast\\nsuffered thy guest to be thus shamefully dealt with. How\\nwould it be now, if the stranger sitting thus in our house,\\nwere to come to some harm all through this evil handling?\\nShame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered her: \\'Mother mine, as to this\\nmatter I count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have\\nI knowledge and understanding of each thing, of the good\\nand of the evil; but heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I\\ncannot devise all things according to wisdom, for these men\\nin their evil counsel drive me from my wits, on this side\\nand on that, and there is none to aid me. Howsoever this\\nbattle between Irus and the stranger did not fall out as\\nthe wooers would have had it, but the stranger proved the\\nbetter man. Would to Father Zeus and Athene and Apollo,\\nthat the wooers in our halls were even now thus vanquished,\\nand wagging their heads, some in the court, and some within\\nthe house, and that the limbs of each man were loosened in\\nsuch fashion as Irus yonder sits now, by the courtyard\\ngates wagging his head, like a drunken man, and cannot\\nstand upright on his feet, nor yet get him home to his own\\nplace, seeing that his limbs are loosened!\\'\\n\\nThus they spake one to another. But Eurymachus spake to\\nPenelope, saying:\\n\\n\\'Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, if all the Achaeans in\\nIasian Argos could behold thee, even a greater press of\\nwooers would feast in your halls from to-morrow\\'s dawn,\\nsince thou dost surpass all women in beauty and stature,\\nand within in wisdom of mind.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him: \\'Eurymachus, surely my\\nexcellence, both of face and form, the gods destroyed in\\nthe day when the Argives embarked for Ilios, and with them\\nwent my lord Odysseus. If but he might come and watch over\\nthis my life, greater thus would be my fame and fairer! But\\nnow am I in sorrow; such a host of ills some god has sent\\nagainst me. Ah, well do I remember, when he set forth and\\nleft his own country, how he took me by the right hand at\\nthe wrist and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'\"Lady, methinks that all the goodly-greaved Achaeans will\\nnot win a safe return from Troy; for the Trojans too, they\\nsay, are good men at arms, as spearsmen, and bowmen, and\\ndrivers of fleet horses, such as ever most swiftly\\ndetermine the great strife of equal battle. Wherefore I\\nknow not if the gods will suffer me to return, or whether I\\nshall be cut off there in Troy; so do thou have a care for\\nall these things. Be mindful of my father and my mother in\\nthe halls, even as now thou art, or yet more than now,\\nwhile I am far away. But when thou seest thy son a bearded\\nman, marry whom thou wilt and leave thine own house.\"\\n\\n\\'Even so did he speak, and now all these things have an\\nend. The night shall come when a hateful marriage shall\\nfind me out, me most luckless, whose good hap Zeus has\\ntaken away. But furthermore this sore trouble has come on\\nmy heart and soul; for this was not the manner of wooers in\\ntime past. Whoso wish to woo a good lady and the daughter\\nof a rich man, and vie one with another, themselves bring\\nwith them oxen of their own and goodly flocks, a banquet\\nfor the friends of the bride, and they give the lady\\nsplendid gifts, but do not devour another\\'s livelihood\\nwithout atonement.\\'\\n\\nThus she spake, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus rejoiced\\nbecause she drew from them gifts, and beguiled their souls\\nwith soothing words, while her heart was set on other\\nthings.\\n\\nThen Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered her again:\\n\\'Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, the gifts which any of\\nthe Achaeans may choose to bring hither, do thou take; for\\nit were ill to withhold a gift. But we for our part will\\nneither go to our lands nor otherwhere, before thou art\\nwedded to the best man of the Achaeans.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Antinous, and the saying pleased them well, and\\neach man sent a henchman to bring his gifts. For Antinous\\nhis henchman bare a broidered robe, great and very fair,\\nwherein were golden brooches, twelve in all, fitted with\\nwell bent clasps. And the henchman straightway bare\\nEurymachus a golden chain of curious work, strung with\\namber beads, shining like the sun. And his squires bare for\\nEurydamas a pair of ear-rings, with three drops well\\nwrought, and much grace shone from them. And out of the\\nhouse of Peisander the prince, the son of Polyctor, the\\nsquire brought a necklet, a very lovely jewel. And likewise\\nthe Achaeans brought each one some other beautiful gift.\\n\\nThen the fair lady went aloft to her upper chamber, and her\\nattendant maidens bare for her the lovely gifts, while the\\nwooers turned to dancing and the delight of song, and\\ntherein took their pleasure, and awaited the coming of\\neventide. And dark evening came on them at their pastime.\\nAnon they set up three braziers in the halls, to give them\\nlight, and on these they laid firewood all around, faggots\\nseasoned long since and sere, and new split with the axe.\\nAnd midway by the braziers they placed torches, and the\\nmaids of Odysseus, of the hardy heart, held up the lights\\nin turn. Then the prince Odysseus of many counsels himself\\nspake among them saying:\\n\\n\\'Ye maidens of Odysseus, the lord so long afar, get ye into\\nthe chambers where the honoured queen abides, and twist the\\nyarn at her side, and gladden her heart as ye sit in the\\nchamber, or card the wools with your hands; but I will\\nminister light to all these that are here. For even if they\\nare minded to wait the throned Dawn, they shall not outstay\\nme, so long enduring am I.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, but they laughed and looked one at the other.\\nAnd the fair Melantho chid him shamefully, Melantho that\\nDolius begat, but Penelope reared, and entreated her\\ntenderly as she had been her own child, and gave her\\nplaythings to her heart\\'s desire. Yet, for all that, sorrow\\nfor Penelope touched not her heart, but she loved\\nEurymachus and was his paramour. Now she chid Odysseus with\\nrailing words:\\n\\n\\'Wretched guest, surely thou art some brain-struck man,\\nseeing that thou dost not choose to go and sleep at a\\nsmithy, or at some place of common resort, but here thou\\npratest much and boldly among many lords and hast no fear\\nat heart. Verily wine has got about thy wits, or perchance\\nthou art always of this mind, and so thou dost babble idly.\\nArt thou beside thyself for joy, because thou hast beaten\\nthe beggar Irus? Take heed lest a better man than Irus rise\\nup presently against thee, to lay his mighty hands about\\nthy head and bedabble thee with blood, and send thee hence\\nfrom the house.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on her, and\\nsaid: \\'Yea, straight will I go yonder and tell Telemachus\\nhereof, thou shameless thing, for this thy speech, that\\nforthwith he may cut thee limb from limb.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and with his saying scared away the women, who\\nfled through the hall, and the knees of each were loosened\\nfor fear, for they deemed that his words were true. But\\nOdysseus took his stand by the burning braziers, tending\\nthe lights, and gazed on all the men: but far other matters\\nhe pondered in his heart, things not to be unfulfilled.\\n\\nNow Athene would in no wise suffer the lordly wooers to\\nabstain from biting scorn, that the pain might sink yet the\\ndeeper into the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes. So\\nEurymachus, son of Polybus, began to speak among them,\\ngirding at Odysseus, and so made mirth for his friends:\\n\\n\\'Hear me ye wooers of the queen renowned, that I may say\\nthat which my spirit within me bids me. Not without the\\ngods\\' will has this man come to the house of Odysseus;\\nmethinks at least that the torchlight flares forth from {*}\\nthat head of his, for there are no hairs on it, nay never\\nso thin.\\'\\n\\n{* Accepting the conjecture [Greek] = [Greek] for the MSS.\\n[Greek]}\\n\\nHe spake and withal addressed Odysseus, waster of cities:\\n\\'Stranger, wouldest thou indeed be my hireling, if I would\\ntake thee for my man, at an upland farm, and thy wages\\nshall be assured thee, and there shalt thou gather stones\\nfor walls and plant tall trees? There would I provide thee\\nbread continual, and clothe thee with raiment, and give\\nthee shoes for thy feet. Howbeit, since thou art practised\\nonly in evil, thou wilt not care to go to the labours of\\nthe field, but wilt choose rather to go louting through the\\nland, that thou mayst have wherewithal to feed thine\\ninsatiate belly.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered him and said:\\n\\'Eurymachus, would that there might be a trial of labour\\nbetween us twain, in the season of spring, when the long\\ndays begin! In the deep grass might it be, and I should\\nhave a crooked scythe, and thou another like it, that we\\nmight try each the other in the matter of labour, fasting\\ntill late eventide, and grass there should be in plenty. Or\\nwould again, that there were oxen to drive, the best there\\nmay be, large and tawny, both well filled with fodder, of\\nequal age and force to bear the yoke and of strength\\nuntiring! And it should be a field of four ploughgates, and\\nthe clod should yield before the ploughshare. Then\\nshouldest thou see me, whether or no I would cut a clean\\nfurrow unbroken before me. Or would that this very day\\nCronion might waken war whence he would, and that I had a\\nshield and two spears, and a helmet all of bronze, close\\nfitting on my temples! Then shouldest thou see me mingling\\nin the forefront of the battle, nor speak and taunt me with\\nthis my belly. Nay, thou art exceeding wanton and thy heart\\nis hard, and thou thinkest thyself some great one and\\nmighty, because thou consortest with few men and feeble.\\nAh, if Odysseus might but return and come to his own\\ncountry, right soon would yonder doors full wide as they\\nare, prove all too strait for thee in thy flight through\\nthe doorway!\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and Eurymachus waxed yet the more wroth at\\nheart, and looking fiercely on him spake to him winged\\nwords:\\n\\n\\'Ah, wretch that thou art, right soon will I work thee\\nmischief, so boldly thou pratest among many lords, and hast\\nno fear at heart. Verily wine has got about thy wits, or\\nperchance thou art always of this mind, and so thou dost\\nbabble idly. Art thou beside thyself for joy, because thou\\nhast beaten the beggar Irus?\\'\\n\\nTherewith he caught up a footstool, but Odysseus sat him\\ndown at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, in dread of\\nEurymachus. And Eurymachus cast and smote the cup-bearer on\\nthe right hand, and the ladle cup dropped to the ground\\nwith a clang, while the young man groaned and fell\\nbackwards in the dust. Then the wooers clamoured through\\nthe shadowy halls, and thus one would say looking to his\\nneighbour:\\n\\n\\'Would that our wandering guest had perished otherwhere, or\\never he came hither; so should he never have made all this\\ntumult in our midst! But now we are all at strife about\\nbeggars, and there will be no more joy of the good feast,\\nfor worse things have their way.\\'\\n\\nThen the mighty prince Telemachus spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Sirs, ye are mad; now doth your mood betray that ye have\\neaten and drunken; some one of the gods is surely moving\\nyou. Nay, now that ye have feasted well, go home and lay\\nyou to rest, since your spirit so bids; for as for me, I\\ndrive no man hence.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and they all bit their lips and marvelled at\\nTelemachus, in that he spake boldly. Then Amphinomus made\\nharangue, and spake among them, Amphinomus, the famous son\\nof Nisus the prince, the son of Aretias:\\n\\n\\'Friends, when a righteous word has been spoken, none\\nsurely would rebuke another with hard speech and be angry.\\nMisuse ye not this stranger, neither any of the thralls\\nthat are in the house of godlike Odysseus. But come, let\\nthe wine-bearer pour for libation into each cup in turn,\\nthat after the drink-offering we may get us home to bed.\\nBut the stranger let us leave in the halls of Odysseus for\\na charge to Telemachus: for to his home has he come.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and his word was well-pleasing to them all.\\nThen the lord Mulius mixed for them the bowl, the henchman\\nout of Dulichium, who was squire of Amphinomus. And he\\nstood by all and served it to them in their turn; and they\\npoured forth before the blessed gods, and drank the\\nhoney-sweet wine. Now when they had poured forth and had\\ndrunken to their hearts\\' content, they departed to lie\\ndown, each one to his own house.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XIX\\n\\n  Telemachus removes the arms out of the hall. Odysseus\\n  disburseth with Penelope. And is known by his nurse, but\\n  concealed. And the hunting of the boar upon that occasion\\n  related.\\n\\nNow the goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall,\\ndevising with Athene\\'s aid the slaying of the wooers, and\\nstraightway he spake winged words to Telemachus:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, we must needs lay by the weapons of war\\nwithin, every one; and when the wooers miss them and ask\\nthee concerning them, thou shalt beguile them with soft\\nwords, saying:\\n\\n\\'Out of the smoke I laid them by, since they were no longer\\nlike those that Odysseus left behind him of old, when he\\nwent to Troy, but they are wholly marred, so mightily hath\\npassed upon them the vapour of fire. Moreover some god hath\\nput into my heart this other and greater care, that\\nperchance when ye are heated with wine, ye set a quarrel\\nbetween you and wound one the other, and thereby shame the\\nfeast and the wooing; for iron of itself draws a man\\nthereto.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father,\\nand called forth to him the nurse Eurycleia and spake to\\nher, saying:\\n\\n\\'Nurse, come now I pray thee, shut up the women in their\\nchambers till I shall have laid by in the armoury the\\ngoodly weapons of my father, which all uncared for the\\nsmoke dims in the hall, since my father went hence, and I\\nwas still but a child. Now I wish to lay them by where the\\nvapour of the fire will not reach them.\\'\\n\\nThen the good nurse Eurycleia answered him, saying: \\'Ah, my\\nchild, if ever thou wouldest but take careful thought in\\nsuch wise as to mind the house, and guard all this wealth!\\nBut come, who shall fetch the light and bear it, if thou\\nhast thy way, since thou wouldest not that the maidens, who\\nmight have given light, should go before thee?\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus made answer to her: \\'This stranger\\nhere, for I will keep no man in idleness who eats of my\\nbread, even if he have come from afar.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and wingless her speech remained, and she\\nclosed the doors of the fair-lying chambers. Then they\\ntwain sprang up, Odysseus and his renowned son, and set to\\ncarry within the helmets and the bossy shields, and the\\nsharp-pointed spears; and before them Pallas Athene bare a\\ngolden cresset and cast a most lovely light. Thereon\\nTelemachus spake to his father suddenly:\\n\\n\\'Father, surely a great marvel is this that I behold with\\nmine eyes; meseems, at least, that the walls of the hall\\nand the fair main-beams of the roof and the cross-beams of\\npine, and the pillars that run aloft, are bright as it were\\nwith flaming fire. Verily some god is within, of those that\\nhold the wide heaven.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him and said: \\'Hold\\nthy peace and keep thy thoughts in check and ask not\\nhereof. Lo, this is the wont of the gods that hold Olympus.\\nBut do thou go and lay thee down, and I will abide here,\\nthat I may yet further provoke the maids ant thy mother to\\nanswer; and she in her sorrow will ask me concerning each\\nthing, one by one.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and Telemachus passed out through the hall to\\nhis chamber to lie down, by the light of the flaming\\ntorches, even to the chamber where of old he took his rest,\\nwhen sweet sleep came over him. There now too he lay down\\nand awaited the bright Dawn. But goodly Odysseus was left\\nbehind in the hall, devising with Athene\\'s aid the slaying\\nof the wooers.\\n\\nNow forth from her chamber came the wise Penelope, like\\nArtemis or golden Aphrodite, and they set a chair for her\\nhard by before the fire, where she was wont to sit, a chair\\nwell-wrought and inlaid with ivory and silver, which on a\\ntime the craftsman Icmalius had fashioned, and had joined\\nthereto a footstool, that was part of the chair, whereon a\\ngreat fleece was used to be laid. Here then, the wise\\nPenelope sat her down, and next came white-armed handmaids\\nfrom the women\\'s chamber, and began to take away the many\\nfragments of food, and the tables and the cups whence the\\nproud lords had been drinking, and they raked out the fire\\nfrom the braziers on to the floor, and piled many fresh\\nlogs upon them, to give light and warmth.\\n\\nThen Melantho began to revile Odysseus yet a second time,\\nsaying: \\'Stranger, wilt thou still be a plague to us here,\\ncircling round the house in the night, and spying the\\nwomen? Nay, get thee forth, thou wretched thing, and be\\nthankful for thy supper, or straightway shalt thou even be\\nsmitten with a torch and so fare out of the doors.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on her, and\\nsaid: \\'Good woman, what possesses thee to assail me thus\\nout of an angry heart? Is it because I go filthy and am\\nclothed about in sorry raiment, and beg through the land,\\nfor necessity is laid on me? This is the manner of beggars\\nand of wandering men. For I too once had a house of mine\\nown among men, a rich man with a wealthy house, and many a\\ntime would I give to a wanderer, what manner of man soever\\nhe might be, and in whatsoever need he came. And I had\\ncountless thralls, and all else in plenty, whereby folk\\nlive well and have a name for riches. But Zeus, the son of\\nCronos, made me desolate of all, for surely it was his\\nwill. Wherefore, woman, see lest some day thou too lose all\\nthy fine show wherein thou now excellest among the\\nhandmaids, as well may chance, if thy mistress be provoked\\nto anger with thee, or if Odysseus come home, for there is\\nyet a place for hope. And even if he hath perished as ye\\ndeem, and is never more to return, yet by Apollo\\'s grace he\\nhath a son like him, Telemachus, and none of the women\\nworks wantonness in his halls without his knowledge, for he\\nis no longer of an age not to mark it,\\n\\nThus he spake, and the wise Penelope heard him, and rebuked\\nthe handmaid, and spake and hailed her:\\n\\n\\'Thou reckless thing and unabashed, be sure thy great sin\\nis not hidden from me, and thy blood shall be on thine own\\nhead for the same! Four thou knewest right well, in that\\nthou hadst heard it from my lips, how that I was minded to\\nask the stranger in my halls for tidings of my lord; for I\\nam grievously afflicted.\\'\\n\\nTherewith she spake likewise to the housedame, Eurynome,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Eurynome, bring hither a settle with a fleece thereon,\\nthat the stranger may sit and speak with me and hear my\\nwords, for I would ask him all his story.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake, and the nurse made haste and brought a\\npolished settle, and cast a fleece thereon; and then the\\nsteadfast goodly Odysseus sat him down there, and the wise\\nPenelope spake first, saying:\\n\\n\\'Stranger, I will make bold first to ask thee this: who art\\nthou of the sons of men, and whence? Where is thy city, and\\nwhere are they that begat thee?\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said: \\'Lady,\\nno one of mortal men in the wide world could find fault\\nwith thee, for lo, thy fame goes up to the wide heaven, as\\ndoth the fame of a blameless king, one that fears the gods\\nand reigns among many men and mighty, maintaining right,\\nand the black earth bears wheat and barley, and the trees\\nare laden with fruit, and the sheep bring forth and fail\\nnot, and the sea gives store of fish, and all out of his\\ngood guidance, and the people prosper under him. Wherefore\\ndo thou ask me now in thy house all else that thou wilt,\\nbut inquire not concerning my race and mine own country,\\nlest as I think thereupon thou fill my heart the more with\\npains, for I am a man of many sorrows. Moreover it beseems\\nme not to sit weeping and wailing in another\\'s house, for\\nit is little good to mourn always without ceasing, lest\\nperchance one of the maidens, or even thyself, be angry\\nwith me and say that I swim in tears, as one that is heavy\\nwith wine.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him, and said: \\'Stranger,\\nsurely my excellence, both of face and form, the gods\\ndestroyed, in the day when the Argives embarked for Ilios,\\nand with them went my lord Odysseus. If but he might come\\nand watch over this my life, greater and fairer thus would\\nbe my fame! But now am I in sorrow, such a host of ills\\nsome god has sent against me. For all the noblest that are\\nprinces in the isles, in Dulichium and Same and wooded\\nZacynthus, and they that dwell around even in clear-seen\\nIthaca, these are wooing me against my will, and devouring\\nthe house. Wherefore I take no heed of strangers, nor\\nsuppliants, nor at all of heralds, the craftsmen of the\\npeople. But I waste my heart away in longing for Odysseus;\\nso they speed on my marriage and I weave a web of wiles.\\nFirst some god put it into my heart to set up a great web\\nin the halls, and thereat to weave a robe fine of woof and\\nvery wide; and anon I spake among them, saying: \"Ye\\nprincely youths, my wooers, now that goodly Odysseus is\\ndead, do ye abide patiently, how eager soever to speed on\\nthis marriage of mine, till I finish the robe. I would not\\nthat the threads perish to no avail, even this shroud for\\nthe hero Laertes, against the day when the ruinous doom\\nshall bring him low, of death that lays men at their\\nlength. So shall none of the Achaean women in the land\\ncount it blame in me, as well might be, were he to lie\\nwithout a winding sheet, a man that had gotten great\\npossessions.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake I, and their high hearts consented thereto. So\\nthen in the daytime I would weave the mighty web, and in\\nthe night unravel the same, when I had let place the\\ntorches by me. Thus for the space of three years I hid the\\nthing by craft and beguiled the minds of the Achaeans. But\\nwhen the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round as\\nthe months waned, and many days were accomplished, then it\\nwas that by help of the handmaids, shameless things and\\nreckless, the wooers came and trapped me, and chid me\\nloudly. Thus did I finish the web by no will of mine, for\\nso I must. And now I can neither escape the marriage nor\\ndevise any further counsel, and my parents are instant with\\nme to marry, and my son chafes that these men devour his\\nlivelihood, as he takes note of all; for by this time he\\nhas come to man\\'s estate; and is full able to care for a\\nhousehold, for one to which Zeus vouchsafes honour. But\\neven so tell me of thine own stock, whence thou art, for\\nthou art not sprung of oak or rock, whereof old tales\\ntell.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said:\\n\\n\\'O wife revered of Odysseus, son of Laertes, wilt thou\\nnever have done asking me about mine own race? Nay, but I\\nwill tell thee: yet surely thou wilt give me over to\\nsorrows yet more than those wherein I am holden, for so it\\never is when a man has been afar from his own country, so\\nlong as now I am, wandering in sore pain to many cities of\\nmortals. Yet even so I will tell thee what thou askest and\\ninquirest. There is a land called Crete in the midst of the\\nwine-dark sea, a fair land and a rich, begirt with water,\\nand therein are many men innumerable, and ninety cities.\\nAnd all have not the same speech, but there is confusion of\\ntongues; there dwell Achaeans and there too Cretans of\\nCrete, high of heart, and Cydonians there and Dorians of\\nwaving plumes and goodly Pelasgians. And among these cities\\nis the mighty city Cnosus, wherein Minos when he was nine\\nyears old began to rule, he who held converse with great\\nZeus, and was the father of my father, even of Deucalion,\\nhigh of heart. Now Deucalion begat me and Idomeneus the\\nprince. Howbeit, he had gone in his beaked ships up into\\nIlios, with the sons of Atreus; but my famed name is\\nAethon, being the younger of the twain and he was the first\\nborn and the better man. There I saw Odysseus, and gave him\\nguest-gifts, for the might of the wind bare him too to\\nCrete, as he was making for Troy land, and had driven him\\nwandering past Malea. So he stayed his ships in Amnisus,\\nwhereby is the cave of Eilithyia, in havens hard to win,\\nand scarce he escaped the tempest. Anon he came up to the\\ncity and asked for Idomeneus, saying that he was his friend\\nand held by him in love and honour. But it was now the\\ntenth or the eleventh dawn since Idomeneus had gone in his\\nbeaked ships up into Ilios. Then I led him to the house,\\nand gave him good entertainment with all loving-kindness\\nout of the plenty in my house, and for him and for the rest\\nof his company, that went with him, I gathered and gave\\nbarley meal and dark wine out of the public store, and oxen\\nto sacrifice to his heart\\'s desire.  There the goodly\\nAchaeans abode twelve days, for the strong North Wind\\npenned them there, and suffered them not to stay upon the\\ncoast, for some angry god had roused it. On the thirteenth\\nday the wind fell, and then they lifted anchor.\\'\\n\\nSo he told many a false tale in the likeness of truth, and\\nher tears flowed as she listened, and her flesh melted. And\\neven as the snow melts in the high places of the hills, the\\nsnow that the South-East wind has thawed, when the West has\\nscattered it abroad, and as it wastes the river streams run\\nfull, even so her fair cheeks melted beneath her tears, as\\nshe wept her own lord, who even then was sitting by her.\\nNow Odysseus had compassion of heart upon his wife in her\\nlamenting, but his eyes kept steadfast between his eyelids\\nas it were horn or iron, and craftily he hid his tears. But\\nshe, when she had taken her fill of tearful lamentation,\\nanswered him in turn and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Friend as thou art, even now I think to make trial of\\nthee, and learn whether in very truth thou didst entertain\\nmy lord there in thy halls with his godlike company, as\\nthou sayest. Tell me what manner of raiment he was clothed\\nin about his body, and what manner of man he was himself,\\nand tell me of his fellows that went with him.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: \\'Lady,\\nit is hard for one so long parted from him to tell thee all\\nthis, for it is now the twentieth year since he went\\nthither and left my country. Yet even so I will tell thee\\nas I see him in spirit. Goodly Odysseus wore a thick purple\\nmantle, twofold, which had a brooch fashioned in gold, with\\ntwo sheathes for the pins, and on the face of it was a\\ncurious device: a hound in his forepaws held a dappled fawn\\nand gazed on it as it writhed. And all men marvelled at the\\nworkmanship, how, wrought as they were in gold, the hound\\nwas gazing on the fawn and strangling it, and the fawn was\\nwrithing with his feet and striving to flee. Moreover, I\\nmarked the shining doublet about his body, like the gleam\\nover the skin of a dried onion, so smooth it was, and\\nglistering as the sun; truly many women looked thereon and\\nwondered. Yet another thing will I tell thee, and do thou\\nponder it in thy heart. I know not if Odysseus was thus\\nclothed upon at home, or if one of his fellows gave him the\\nraiment as he went on board the swift ship, or even it may\\nbe some stranger, seeing that to many men was Odysseus\\ndear, for few of the Achaeans were his peers. I, too, gave\\nhim a sword of bronze, and a fair purple mantle with double\\nfold, and a tasseled doublet, and I sent him away with all\\nhonour on his decked ship. Moreover, a henchman bare him\\ncompany, somewhat older than he, and I will tell thee of\\nhim too, what manner of man he was. He was\\nround-shouldered, black-skinned, and curly-headed, his name\\nEurybates; and Odysseus honoured him above all his company,\\nbecause in all things he was like-minded with himself.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and in her heart he stirred yet more the\\ndesire of weeping, as she knew the certain tokens that\\nOdysseus showed her. So when she had taken her fill of\\ntearful lament, then she answered him, and spake saying:\\n\\n\\'Now verily, stranger, thou that even before wert held in\\npity, shalt be dear and honourable in my halls, for it was\\nI who gave him these garments, as judging from thy words,\\nand folded them myself, and brought them from the chamber,\\nand added besides the shining brooch to be his jewel. But\\nhim I shall never welcome back, returned home to his own\\ndear country. Wherefore with an evil fate it was that\\nOdysseus went hence in the hollow ship to see that evil\\nIlios, never to be named.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: \\'Wife\\nrevered of Odysseus, son of Laertes, destroy not now thy\\nfair flesh any more, nor waste thy heart with weeping for\\nthy lord;--not that I count it any blame in thee, for many\\na woman weeps that has lost her wedded lord, to whom she\\nhas borne children in her love,--albeit a far other man\\nthan Odysseus, who, they say, is like the gods. Nay, cease\\nfrom thy lamenting, and lay up my word in thy heart; for I\\nwill tell thee without fail, and will hide nought, how but\\nlately I heard tell of the return of Odysseus, that he is\\nnigh at hand, and yet alive in the fat land of the men of\\nThesprotia, and is bringing with him many choice treasures,\\nas he begs through the land. But he has lost his dear\\ncompanions and his hollow ship on the wine-dark sea, on his\\nway from the isle Thrinacia: for Zeus and Helios had a\\ngrudge against him, because his company had slain the kine\\nof Helios. They for their part all perished in the wash of\\nthe sea, but the wave cast him on the keel of the ship out\\nupon the coast, on the land of the Phaeacians that are near\\nof kin to the gods, and they did him all honour heartily as\\nunto a god, and gave him many gifts, and themselves would\\nfain have sent him scathless home. Yea and Odysseus would\\nhave been here long since, but he thought it more\\nprofitable to gather wealth, as he journeyed over wide\\nlands; so truly is Odysseus skilled in gainful arts above\\nall men upon earth, nor may any mortal men contend with\\nhim. So Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me. Moreover\\nhe sware, in mine own presence, as he poured the\\ndrink-offering in his house, that the ship was drawn down\\nto the sea and his company were ready, who were to convey\\nhim to his own dear country. But me he first sent off, for\\nit chanced that a ship of the Thesprotians was on her way\\nto Dulichium, a land rich in grain. And he showed me all\\nthe wealth that Odysseus had gathered, yea it would suffice\\nfor his children after him, even to the tenth generation,\\nso great were the treasures he had stored in the chambers\\nof the king. As for him he had gone, he said, to Dodona to\\nhear the counsel of Zeus, from the high leafy oak tree of\\nthe god, how he should return to his own dear country,\\nhaving now been long afar, whether openly or by stealth.\\n\\n\\'In this wise, as I tell thee, he is safe and will come\\nshortly, and very near he is and will not much longer be\\nfar from his friends and his own country; yet withal I will\\ngive thee my oath on it. Zeus be my witness first, of gods\\nthe highest and best, and the hearth of noble Odysseus\\nwhereunto I am come, that all these things shall surely be\\naccomplished even as I tell thee. In this same year\\nOdysseus shall come hither, as the old moon wanes and the\\nnew is born.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him: \\'Ah! stranger, would that\\nthis word may be accomplished. Soon shouldst thou be aware\\nof kindness and many a gift at my hands, so that whoso met\\nwith thee would call thee blessed. But on this wise my\\nheart has a boding, and so it shall be. Neither shall\\nOdysseus come home any more, nor shalt thou gain an escort\\nhence, since there are not now such masters in the house as\\nOdysseus was among men,--if ever such an one there was,--\\nto welcome guests revered and speed them on their way. But\\ndo ye, my handmaids, wash this man\\'s feet and strew a couch\\nfor him, bedding and mantles and shining blankets, that\\nwell and warmly he may come to the time of golden-throned\\nDawn. And very early in the morning bathe him and anoint\\nhim, that within the house beside Telemachus he may eat\\nmeat, sitting quietly in the hall. And it shall be the\\nworse for any hurtful man of the wooers, that vexes the\\nstranger, yea he shall not henceforth profit himself here,\\nfor all his sore anger. For how shalt thou learn concerning\\nme, stranger, whether indeed I excel all women in wit and\\nthrifty device, if all unkempt and evil clad thou sittest\\nat supper in my halls? Man\\'s life is brief enough! And if\\nany be a hard man and hard at heart, all men cry evil on\\nhim for the time to come, while yet he lives, and all men\\nmock him when he is dead. But if any be a blameless man and\\nblameless of heart, his guests spread abroad his fame over\\nthe whole earth and many people call him noble.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said: \\'O\\nwife revered of Odysseus, son of Laertes, mantles verily\\nand shining blankets are hateful to me, since first I left\\nbehind me the snowy hills of Crete, voyaging in the\\nlong-oared galley; nay, I will lie as in time past I was\\nused to rest through the sleepless nights. For full many a\\nnight I have lain on an unsightly bed, and awaited the\\nbright throned Dawn. And baths for the feet are no longer\\nmy delight, nor shall any women of those who are serving\\nmaidens in thy house touch my foot, unless there chance to\\nbe some old wife, true of heart, one that has borne as much\\ntrouble as myself; I would not grudge such an one to touch\\nmy feet.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him: \\'Dear stranger, for never\\nyet has there come to my house, of strangers from afar, a\\ndearer man or so discreet as thou, uttering so heedfully\\nthe words of wisdom. I have an ancient woman of an\\nunderstanding heart, that diligently nursed and tended that\\nhapless man my lord, she took him in her arms in the hour\\nwhen his mother bare him. She will wash thy feet, albeit\\nher strength is frail. Up now, wise Eurycleia, and wash\\nthis man, whose years are the same as thy master\\'s. Yea and\\nperchance such even now are the feet of Odysseus, and such\\ntoo his hands, for quickly men age in misery.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake, and the old woman covered her face with her\\nhands and shed hot tears, and spake a word of lamentation,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Ah, woe is me, child, for thy sake, all helpless that I\\nam! Surely Zeus hated thee above all men, though thou hadst\\na god-fearing spirit! For never yet did any mortal burn so\\nmany fat pieces of the thigh and so many choice hecatombs\\nto Zeus, whose joy is in the thunder, as thou didst give to\\nhim, praying that so thou mightest grow to a smooth old age\\nand rear thy renowned son. But now from thee alone hath\\nZeus wholly cut off the day of thy returning.  Haply at him\\ntoo did the women mock in a strange land afar, whensoever\\nhe came to the famous palace of any lord, even as here\\nthese shameless ones all mock at thee. To shun their\\ninsults and many taunts it is that thou sufferest them not\\nto wash thy feet, but the daughter of Icarius, wise\\nPenelope, hath bidden me that am right willing to this\\ntask. Wherefore I will wash thy feet, both for Penelope\\'s\\nsake and for thine own, for that my heart within me is\\nmoved and troubled. But come, mark the word that I shall\\nspeak. Many strangers travel-worn have ere now come hither,\\nbut I say that I have never seen any so like another, as\\nthou art like Odysseus, in fashion in voice and in feet.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: \\'Old\\nwife, even so all men declare, that have beheld us twain,\\nthat we favour each other exceedingly, even as thou dost\\nmark and say.\\'\\n\\nThereupon the crone took the shining cauldron, wherefrom\\n{*} she set to wash his feet, and poured in much cold water\\nand next mingled therewith the warm. Now Odysseus sat aloof\\nfrom the hearth, and of a sudden he turned his face to the\\ndarkness, for anon he had a misgiving of heart lest when\\nshe handled him she might know the scar again, and all\\nshould be revealed. Now she drew near her lord to wash him,\\nand straightway she knew the scar of the wound, that the\\nboar had dealt him with his white tusk long ago, when\\nOdysseus went to Parnassus to see Autolycus, and the sons\\nof Autolycus, his mother\\'s noble father, who outdid all men\\nin thievery and skill in swearing. This skill was the gift\\nof the god himself, even Hermes, for that he burned to him\\nthe well-pleasing sacrifice of the thighs of lambs and\\nkids; wherefore Hermes abetted him gladly. Now Autolycus\\nonce had gone to the rich land of Ithaca, and found his\\ndaughter\\'s son a child new-born, and when he was making an\\nend of supper, behold, Eurycleia set the babe on his knees,\\nand spake and hailed him: \\'Autolycus find now a name\\nthyself to give thy child\\'s own son; for lo, he is a child\\nof many prayers.\\'\\n\\n{* Reading [Greek]}\\n\\nThen Autolycus made answer and spake: \\'My daughter and my\\ndaughter\\'s lord, give ye him whatsoever name I tell you.\\nForasmuch as I am come hither in wrath against many a one,\\nboth man and woman, over the fruitful earth, wherefore let\\nthe child\\'s name be \"a man of wrath,\" Odysseus. But when\\nthe child reaches his full growth, and comes to the great\\nhouse of his mother\\'s kin at Parnassus, whereby are my\\npossessions, I will give him a gift out of these and send\\nhim on his way rejoicing.\\'\\n\\nTherefore it was that Odysseus went to receive the splendid\\ngifts. And Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus grasped his\\nhands and greeted him with gentle words, and Amphithea, his\\nmother\\'s mother, clasped him in her arms and kissed his\\nface and both his fair eyes. Then Autolycus called to his\\nrenowned sons to get ready the meal, and they hearkened to\\nthe call. So presently they led in a five-year-old bull,\\nwhich they flayed and busily prepared, and cut up all the\\nlimbs and deftly chopped them small, and pierced them with\\nspits and roasted them cunningly, dividing the messes. So\\nfor that livelong day they feasted till the going down of\\nthe sun, and their soul lacked not ought of the equal\\nbanquet. But when the sun sank and darkness came on, they\\nlaid them to rest and took the boon of sleep.\\n\\nNow so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,\\nthey all went forth to the chase, the hounds and the sons\\nof Autolycus, and with them went the goodly Odysseus. So\\nthey fared up the steep hill of wood-clad Parnassus, and\\nquickly they came to the windy hollows. Now the sun was but\\njust striking on the fields, and was come forth from the\\nsoft flowing stream of deep Oceanus. Then the beaters\\nreached a glade of the woodland, and before them went the\\nhounds tracking a scent, but behind came the sons of\\nAutolycus, and among them goodly Odysseus followed close on\\nthe hounds, swaying a long spear. Thereby in a thick lair\\nwas a great boar lying, and through the coppice the force\\nof the wet winds blew never, neither did the bright sun\\nlight on it with his rays, nor could the rain pierce\\nthrough, so thick it was, and of fallen leaves there was\\ngreat plenty therein. Then the tramp of the men\\'s feet and\\nof the dogs\\' came upon the boar, as they pressed on in the\\nchase, and forth from his lair he sprang towards them with\\ncrest well bristled and fire shining in his eyes, and stood\\nat bay before them all. Then Odysseus was the first to rush\\nin, holding his spear aloft in his strong hand, most eager\\nto stab him; but the boar was too quick and drave a gash\\nabove the knee, ripping deep into the flesh with his tusk\\nas he charged sideways, but he reached not to the bone of\\nthe man. Then Odysseus aimed well and smote him on his\\nright shoulder, so that the point of the bright spear went\\nclean through, and the boar fell in the dust with a cry,\\nand his life passed from him. Then the dear sons of\\nAutolycus began to busy them with the carcase, and as for\\nthe wound of the noble godlike Odysseus, they bound it up\\nskilfully, and stayed the black blood with a song of\\nhealing, and straight-way returned to the house of their\\ndear father. Then Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus got\\nhim well healed of his hurt, and gave him splendid gifts,\\nand quickly sent him with all love to Ithaca, gladly\\nspeeding a glad guest. There his father and lady mother\\nwere glad of his returning, and asked him of all his\\nadventures, and of his wound how he came by it, and duly he\\ntold them all, namely how the boar gashed him with his\\nwhite tusk in the chase, when he had gone to Parnassus with\\nthe sons of Autolycus.\\n\\nNow the old woman took the scarred limb and passed her\\nhands down it, and knew it by the touch and let the foot\\ndrop suddenly, so that the knee fell into the bath, and the\\nbrazen vessel rang, being turned over on the other side,\\nand behold, the water was spilled on the ground. Then joy\\nand anguish came on her in one moment, and both her eyes\\nfilled up with tears, and the voice of her utterance was\\nstayed, and touching the chin of Odysseus she spake to him,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Yea verily, thou art Odysseus, my dear child, and I knew\\nthee not before, till I had handled all the body of my\\nlord.\\'\\n\\nTherewithal she looked towards Penelope, as minded to make\\na sign that her husband was now home. But Penelope could\\nnot meet her eyes nor take note of her, for Athene had bent\\nher thoughts to other things. But Odysseus feeling for the\\nold woman\\'s throat gript it with his right hand and with\\nthe other drew her closer to him and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Woman, why wouldest thou indeed destroy me? It was thou\\nthat didst nurse me there at thine own breast, and now\\nafter travail and much pain I am come in the twentieth year\\nto mine own country. But since thou art ware of me, and the\\ngod has put this in thy heart, be silent, lest another\\nlearn the matter in the halls. For on this wise I will\\ndeclare it, and it shall surely be accomplished:--if the\\ngods subdue the lordly wooers unto me, I will not hold my\\nhand from thee, my nurse though thou art, when I slay the\\nother handmaids in my halls.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Eurycleia answered, saying: \\'My child, what word\\nhath escaped the door of thy lips? Thou knowest how firm is\\nmy spirit and unyielding, and I will keep me fast as\\nstubborn stone or iron. Yet another thing will I tell thee,\\nand do thou ponder it in thine heart. If the gods subdue\\nthe lordly wooers to thy hand, then will I tell thee all\\nthe tale of the women in the halls, which of them dishonour\\nthee and which be guiltless.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: \\'Nurse,\\nwherefore I pray thee wilt thou speak of these? Thou\\nneedest not, for even I myself will mark them well and take\\nknowledge of each. Nay, do thou keep thy saying to thyself,\\nand leave the rest to the gods.\\'\\n\\nEven so he spake, and the old woman passed forth from the\\nhall to bring water for his feet, for that first water was\\nall spilled. So when she had washed him and anointed him\\nwell with olive-oil, Odysseus again drew up his settle\\nnearer to the fire to warm himself, and covered up the scar\\nwith his rags. Then the wise Penelope spake first, saying:\\n\\n\\'Stranger, there is yet a little thing I will make bold to\\nask thee, for soon will it be the hour for pleasant rest,\\nfor him on whomsoever sweet sleep falls, though he be heavy\\nwith care. But to me has the god given sorrow, yea sorrow\\nmeasureless, for all the day I have my fill of wailing and\\nlamenting, as I look to mine own housewiferies and to the\\ntasks of the maidens in the house. But when night comes and\\nsleep takes hold of all, I lie on my couch, and shrewd\\ncares, thick thronging about my inmost heart, disquiet me\\nin my sorrowing. Even as when the daughter of Pandareus,\\nthe nightingale of the greenwood, sings sweet in the first\\nseason of the spring, from her place in the thick leafage\\nof the trees, and with many a turn and trill she pours\\nforth her full-voiced music bewailing her child, dear\\nItylus, whom on a time she slew with the sword unwitting,\\nItylus the son of Zethus the prince; even as her song, my\\ntroubled soul sways to and fro. Shall I abide with my son,\\nand keep all secure, all the things of my getting, my\\nthralls and great high-roofed home, having respect unto the\\nbed of my lord and the voice of the people, or even now\\nfollow with the best of the Achaeans that woos me in the\\nhalls, and gives a bride-price beyond reckoning? Now my\\nson, so long as he was a child and light of heart, suffered\\nme not to marry and leave the house of my husband; but now\\nthat he is great of growth, and is come to the full measure\\nof manhood, lo now he prays me to go back home from these\\nwalls, being vexed for his possessions that the Achaeans\\ndevour before his eyes. But come now, hear a dream of mine\\nand tell me the interpretation thereof. Twenty geese I have\\nin the house, that eat wheat, coming forth from the water,\\nand I am gladdened at the sight. Now a great eagle of\\ncrooked beak swooped from the mountain, and brake all their\\nnecks and slew them; and they lay strewn in a heap in the\\nhalls, while he was borne aloft to the bright air. Thereon\\nI wept and wailed, in a dream though it was, and around me\\nwere gathered the fair-tressed Achaean women as I made\\npiteous lament, for that the eagle had slain my geese. But\\nhe came back and sat him down on a jutting point of the\\nroof-beam, and with the voice of a man he spake, and stayed\\nmy weeping:\\n\\n\\'\"Take heart, O daughter of renowned Icarius; this is no\\ndream but a true vision, that shall be accomplished for\\nthee. The geese are the wooers, and I that before was the\\neagle am now thy husband come again, who will let slip\\nunsightly death upon all the wooers.\" With that word sweet\\nslumber let me go, and I looked about, and beheld the geese\\nin the court pecking their wheat at the trough, where they\\nwere wont before.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said:\\n\\'Lady, none may turn aside the dream to interpret it\\notherwise, seeing that Odysseus himself hath showed thee\\nhow he will fulfil it. For the wooers destruction is\\nclearly boded, for all and every one; not a man shall avoid\\ndeath and the fates.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him: \\'Stranger, verily dreams\\nare hard, and hard to be discerned; nor are all things\\ntherein fulfilled for men. Twain are the gates of shadowy\\ndreams, the one is fashioned of horn and one of ivory. Such\\ndreams as pass through the portals of sawn ivory are\\ndeceitful, and bear tidings that are unfulfilled. But the\\ndreams that come forth through the gates of polished horn\\nbring a true issue, whosoever of mortals beholds them. Yet\\nmethinks my strange dream came not thence; of a truth that\\nwould be most welcome to me and to my son. But another\\nthing will I tell thee, and do thou ponder it in thy heart.\\nLo, even now draws nigh the morn of evil name, that is to\\nsever me from the house of Odysseus, for now I am about to\\nordain for a trial those axes that he would set up in a row\\nin his halls, like stays of oak in ship-building, twelve in\\nall, and he would stand far apart and shoot his arrow\\nthrough them all. And now I will offer this contest to the\\nwooers; whoso shall most easily string the bow in his\\nhands, and shoot through all twelve axes, with him will I\\ngo and forsake this house, this house of my wedlock, so\\nfair and filled with all livelihood, which methinks I shall\\nyet remember, aye, in a dream.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said: \\'Wife\\nrevered of Odysseus son of Laertes, no longer delay this\\ncontest in thy halls; for, lo, Odysseus of many counsels\\nwill be here, before these men, for all their handling of\\nthis polished bow, shall have strung it, and shot the arrow\\nthrough the iron.\\'\\n\\nThen the wise Penelope answered him: \\'Stranger, if only\\nthou wert willing still to sit beside me in the halls and\\nto delight me, not upon my eyelids would sleep be shed. But\\nmen may in no wise abide sleepless ever, for the immortals\\nhave made a time for all things for mortals on the\\ngrain-giving earth. Howbeit I will go aloft to my upper\\nchamber, and lay me on my bed, the place of my groanings,\\nthat is ever watered by my tears, since the day that\\nOdysseus went to see that evil Ilios, never to be named.\\nThere will I lay me down, but do thou lie in this house;\\neither strew thee somewhat on the floor, or let them lay\\nbedding for thee.\\'\\n\\nTherewith she ascended to her shining upper chamber, not\\nalone, for with her likewise went her handmaids. So she\\nwent aloft to her upper chamber with the women her\\nhandmaids, and there was bewailing Odysseus, her dear lord,\\ntill grey-eyed Athene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XX\\n\\n  Pallas and Odysseus consult of the killing of the wooers.\\n\\nBut the goodly Odysseus laid him down to sleep in the\\nvestibule of the house. He spread an undressed bull\\'s hide\\non the ground and above it many fleeces of sheep, that the\\nAchaeans were wont to slay in sacrifice, and Eurynome threw\\na mantle over him where he lay. There Odysseus lay wakeful,\\nwith evil thoughts against the wooers in his heart. And the\\nwomen came forth from their chamber, that aforetime were\\nwont to lie with the wooers, making laughter and mirth\\namong themselves. Then the heart of Odysseus was stirred\\nwithin his breast, and much he communed with his mind and\\nsoul, whether he should leap forth upon them and deal death\\nto each, or suffer them to lie with the proud wooers, now\\nfor the last and latest time. And his heart growled\\nsullenly within him. And even as a bitch stands over her\\ntender whelps growling, when she spies a man she knows not,\\nand she is eager to assail him, so growled his heart within\\nhim in his wrath at their evil deeds. Then he smote upon\\nhis breast and rebuked his own heart, saying:\\n\\n\\'Endure, my heart; yea, a baser thing thou once didst bear,\\non that day when the Cyclops, unrestrained in fury,\\ndevoured the mighty men of my company; but still thou didst\\nendure till thy craft found a way for thee forth from out\\nthe cave, where thou thoughtest to die.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, chiding his own spirit within him, and his\\nheart verily abode steadfast in obedience to his word. But\\nOdysseus himself lay tossing this way and that. And as when\\na man by a great fire burning takes a paunch full of fat\\nand blood, and turns it this way and that and longs to have\\nit roasted most speedily, so Odysseus tossed from side to\\nside, musing how he might stretch forth his hands upon the\\nshameless wooers, being but one man against so many. Then\\ndown from heaven came Athene and drew nigh him, fashioned\\nin the likeness of a woman. And she stood over his head and\\nspake to him, saying:\\n\\n\\'Lo now again, wherefore art thou watching, most luckless\\nof all men living? Is not this thy house and is not thy\\nwife there within and thy child, such a son as men wish to\\nhave for their own?\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: \\'Yea,\\ngoddess, all this thou hast spoken as is meet. But my heart\\nwithin me muses in some measure upon this, how I may\\nstretch forth my hands upon the shameless wooers, being but\\none man, while they abide ever in their companies within.\\nMoreover this other and harder matter I ponder in my heart:\\neven if I were to slay them by thy will and the will of\\nZeus, whither should I flee from the avengers? Look well to\\nthis, I pray thee.\\'\\n\\nThen answered the goddess, grey-eyed Athene: \\'O hard of\\nbelief! yea, many there be that trust even in a weaker\\nfriend than I am, in one that is a mortal and knows not\\nsuch craft as mine; but I am a god, that preserve thee to\\nthe end, in all manner of toils. And now I will tell thee\\nplainly; even should fifty companies of mortal men compass\\nus about eager to slay us in battle, even their kine\\nshouldst thou drive off and their brave flocks. But let\\nsleep in turn come over thee; to wake and to watch all\\nnight, this too is vexation of spirit; and soon shalt thou\\nrise from out of thy troubles.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake and poured slumber upon his eyelids, but for\\nher part the fair goddess went back to Olympus.\\n\\nWhile sleep laid hold of him loosening the cares of his\\nsoul, sleep that loosens the limbs of men, his good wife\\nawoke and wept as she sat on her soft bed. But when she had\\ntaken her fill of weeping, to Artemis first the fair lady\\nmade her prayer:\\n\\n\\'Artemis, lady and goddess, daughter of Zeus, would that\\neven now thou wouldst plant thy shaft within my breast and\\ntake my life away, even in this hour! Or else, would that\\nthe stormwind might snatch me up, and bear me hence down\\nthe dusky ways, and cast me forth where the back-flowing\\nOceanus mingles with the sea. It should be even as when the\\nstormwinds bare away the daughters of Pandareus. Their\\nfather and their mother the gods had slain, and the maidens\\nwere left orphans in the halls, and fair Aphrodite\\ncherished them with curds and sweet honey and delicious\\nwine. And Here gave them beauty and wisdom beyond the lot\\nof women, and holy Artemis dowered them with stature, and\\nAthene taught them skill in all famous handiwork. Now while\\nfair Aphrodite was wending to high Olympus, to pray that a\\nglad marriage might be accomplished for the maidens,--and\\nto Zeus she went whose joy is in the thunder, for he knows\\nall things well, what the fates give and deny to mortal\\nmen--in the meanwhile the spirits of the storm snatched\\naway these maidens, and gave them to be handmaids to the\\nhateful Erinyes. Would that in such wise they that hold the\\nmansions of Olympus would take me from the sight of men, or\\nthat fair-stressed Artemis would strike me, that so with a\\nvision of Odysseus before mine eyes I might even pass\\nbeneath the dreadful earth, nor ever make a baser man\\'s\\ndelight! But herein is an evil that may well be borne,\\nnamely, when a man weeps all the day long in great sorrow\\nof heart, but sleep takes him in the night, for sleep makes\\nhim forgetful of all things, of good and evil, when once it\\nhas overshadowed his eyelids. But as for me, even the\\ndreams that the gods send upon me are evil. For\\nfurthermore, this very night one seemed to lie by my side,\\nin the likeness of my lord, as he was when he went with the\\nhost, and then was my heart glad, since methought it was no\\nvain dream but a clear vision at the last.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake, and anon came the golden throned Dawn. Now\\ngoodly Odysseus caught the voice of her weeping, and then\\nhe fell a musing, and it seemed to him that even now she\\nknew him and was standing by his head. So he took up the\\nmantle and the fleeces whereon he was lying, and set them\\non a high seat in the hall, and bare out the bull\\'s hide\\nout of doors and laid it there, and lifting up his hands he\\nprayed to Zeus:\\n\\n\\'Father Zeus, if ye gods of your good will have led me over\\nwet and dry, to mine own country, after ye had plagued me\\nsore, let some one I pray of the folk that are waking show\\nme a word of good omen within, and without let some sign\\nalso be revealed to me from Zeus.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake in prayer, and Zeus, the counsellor, heard him.\\nStraightway he thundered from shining Olympus, from on high\\nfrom the place of clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad.\\nMoreover a woman, a grinder at the mill, uttered a voice of\\nomen from within the house hard by, where stood the mills\\nof the shepherd of the people. At these handmills twelve\\nwomen in all plied their task, making meal of barley and of\\nwheat, the marrow of men. Now all the others were asleep,\\nfor they had ground out their task of grain, but one alone\\nrested not yet, being the weakest of all. She now stayed\\nher quern and spake a word, a sign to her lord:\\n\\n\\'Father Zeus, who rulest over gods and men, loudly hast\\nthou thundered from the starry sky, yet nowhere is there a\\ncloud to be seen: this surely is a portent thou art showing\\nto some mortal. Fulfil now, I pray thee, even to miserable\\nme, the word that I shall speak. May the wooers, on this\\nday, for the last and latest time make their sweet feasting\\nin the halls of Odysseus! They that have loosened my knees\\nwith cruel toil to grind their barley meal, may they now\\nsup their last!\\'\\n\\nThus she spake, and goodly Odysseus was glad in the omen of\\nthe voice and in the thunder of Zeus; for he thought that\\nhe had gotten his vengeance on the guilty.\\n\\nNow the other maidens in the fair halls of Odysseus had\\ngathered, and were kindling on the hearth the never-resting\\nfire. And Telemachus rose from his bed, a godlike man, and\\nput on his raiment, and slung a sharp sword about his\\nshoulders, and beneath his shining feet he bound his goodly\\nsandals. And he caught up his mighty spear shod with sharp\\nbronze, and went and stood by the threshold, and spake to\\nEurycleia:\\n\\n\\'Dear nurse, have ye honoured our guest in the house with\\nfood and couch, or does he lie uncared for, as he may? For\\nthis is my mother\\'s way, wise as she is: blindly she\\nhonours one of mortal men, even the worse, but the better\\nshe sends without honour away.\\'\\n\\nThen the prudent Eurycleia answered: \\'Nay, my child, thou\\nshouldst not now blame her where no blame is. For the\\nstranger sat and drank wine, so long as he would, and of\\nfood he said he was no longer fain, for thy mother asked\\nhim. Moreover, against the hour when he should bethink him\\nof rest and sleep, she bade the maidens strew for him a\\nbed. But he, as one utterly wretched and ill-fated, refused\\nto lie on a couch and under blankets, but on an undressed\\nhide and on the fleeces of sheep he slept in the vestibule,\\nand we cast a mantle over him.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake, and Telemachus passed out through the hall\\nwith his lance in his hand, and two fleet dogs bare him\\ncompany. He went on his way to the assembly-place to join\\nthe goodly-greaved Achaeans. But the good lady Eurycleia,\\ndaughter of Ops son of Peisenor, called aloud to her\\nmaidens:\\n\\n\\'Come hither, let some of you go busily and sweep the hall,\\nand sprinkle it, and on the fair-fashioned seats throw\\npurple coverlets, and others with sponges wipe all the\\ntables clean, and cleanse the mixing bowls and well-wrought\\ndouble beakers, and others again go for water to the well,\\nand return with it right speedily. For the wooers will not\\nlong be out of the hall but will return very early, for it\\nis a feast day, yea for all the people.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake, and they all gave ready ear and hearkened.\\nTwenty of them went to the well of dark water, and the\\nothers there in the halls were busy with skilful hands.\\n\\nThen in came the serving-men of the Achaeans. Thereon they\\ncleft the faggots well and cunningly, while, behold, the\\nwomen came back from the well. Then the swineherd joined\\nthem leading three fatted boars, the best in all the flock.\\nThese he left to feed at large in the fair courts, but as\\nfor him he spake to Odysseus gently, saying:\\n\\n\\'Tell me, stranger, do the Achaeans at all look on thee\\nwith more regard, or do they dishonour thee in the halls,\\nas heretofore?\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying:\\n\\n\\'Oh, that the gods, Eumaeus, may avenge the scorn wherewith\\nthese men deal insolently, and devise infatuate deeds in\\nanother\\'s house, and have no place for shame!\\'\\n\\nOn such wise they spake one to another. And Melanthius drew\\nnear them, the goatherd, leading the goats that were most\\nexcellent in all the herds to be a dinner for the wooers,\\nand two shepherds bare him company. So he tethered the\\ngoats beneath the echoing gallery, and himself spake to\\nOdysseus and taunted him, saying:\\n\\n\\'Stranger, wilt thou still be a plague to us here in the\\nhall, with thy begging of men, and wilt not get thee gone?\\nIn no wise do I think we twain will be sundered, till we\\ntaste each the other\\'s fists, for thy begging is out of all\\norder. Also there are elsewhere other feasts of the\\nAchaeans.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, but Odysseus of many counsels answered him not\\na word, but in silence he shook his head, brooding evil in\\nthe deep of his heart.\\n\\nMoreover a third man came up, Philoetius, a master of men,\\nleading a barren heifer for the wooers and fatted goats.\\nNow ferrymen had brought them over from the mainland,\\nboatmen who send even other folks on their way, whosoever\\ncomes to them. The cattle he tethered carefully beneath the\\nechoing gallery, and himself drew close to the swineherd,\\nand began to question him:\\n\\n\\'Swineherd, who is this stranger but newly come to our\\nhouse? From what men does he claim his birth? Where are his\\nkin and his native fields? Hapless is he, yet in fashion he\\nis like a royal lord; but the gods mar the goodliness of\\nwandering men, when even for kings they have woven the web\\nof trouble.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and came close to him offering his right hand\\nin welcome, and uttering his voice spake to him winged\\nwords:\\n\\n\\'Father and stranger, hail! may happiness be thine in the\\ntime to come; but as now, thou art fast holden in many\\nsorrows! Father Zeus, none other god is more baneful than\\nthou; thou hast no compassion on men, that are of thine own\\nbegetting, but makest them to have fellowship with evil and\\nwith bitter pains. The sweat brake out on me when I beheld\\nhim, and mine eyes stand full of tears for memory of\\nOdysseus, for he too, methinks, is clad in such vile\\nraiment as this, and is wandering among men, if haply he\\nyet lives and sees the sunlight. But if he be dead already\\nand in the house of Hades, then woe is me for the noble\\nOdysseus, who set me over his cattle while I was but a lad\\nin the land of the Cephallenians. And now these wax\\nnumberless; in no better wise could the breed of\\nbroad-browed cattle of any mortal increase, even as the\\nears of corn. But strangers command me to be ever driving\\nthese for themselves to devour, and they care nothing for\\nthe heir in the house, nor tremble at the vengeance of the\\ngods, for they are eager even now to divide among\\nthemselves the possessions of our lord who is long afar.\\nNow my heart within my breast often revolves this thing.\\nTruly it were an evil deed, while a son of the master is\\nyet alive, to get me away to the land of strangers, and go\\noff, with cattle and all, to alien men. But this is more\\ngrievous still, to abide here in affliction watching over\\nthe herds of other men. Yea, long ago I would have fled and\\ngone forth to some other of the proud kings, for things are\\nnow past sufferance; but still my thought is of that\\nhapless one, if he might come I know not whence, and make a\\nscattering of the wooers in the halls.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying:\\n\\n\\'Neatherd, seeing thou art not like to an evil man or a\\nfoolish, and of myself I mark how that thou hast gotten\\nunderstanding of heart, therefore I will tell thee\\nsomewhat, and swear a great oath to confirm it. Be Zeus now\\nmy witness before any god, and the hospitable board and the\\nhearth of noble Odysseus, whereunto I am come, that while\\nthou art still in this place Odysseus shall come home, and\\nthou shalt see with thine eyes, if thou wilt, the slaying\\nof the wooers who lord it here.\\'\\n\\nThen the neatherd made answer, saying:\\n\\n\\'Ah, would, stranger, that Cronion may accomplish this\\nword! So shouldst thou know what my might is, and how my\\nhands follow to obey.\\'\\n\\nIn like manner Eumaeus prayed to all the gods, that wise\\nOdysseus might return to his own home.\\n\\nOn such wise they spake one to the other, but the wooers at\\nthat time were framing death and doom for Telemachus. Even\\nso there came by them a bird on their left, an eagle of\\nlofty flight, with a cowering dove in his clutch. Then\\nAmphinomus made harangue and spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Friends, this counsel of ours will not go well, namely,\\nthe slaying of Telemachus; rather let us bethink us of the\\nfeast.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Amphinomus, and his saying pleased them well. They\\npassed into the halls of godlike Odysseus and laid by their\\nmantles on the chairs and high seats, and sacrificed great\\nsheep and stout goats and the fatlings of the boars and the\\nheifer of the herd; then they roasted the entrails and\\nserved them round and mixed wine in the bowl, and the\\nswineherd set a cup by each man. And Philoetius, a master\\nof men, handed them wheaten bread in beautiful baskets, and\\nMelanthius poured out the wine. So they put forth their\\nhands on the good cheer set before them.\\n\\nNow Telemachus, in his crafty purpose, made Odysseus to sit\\ndown within the stablished hall by the threshold of stone,\\nand placed for him a mean settle and a little table. He set\\nby him his mess of the entrails, and poured wine into a\\ngolden cup and spake to him, saying:\\n\\n\\'There, sit thee down, drinking thy wine among the lords,\\nand the taunts and buffets of all the wooers I myself will\\nward off from thee, for this is no house of public resort,\\nbut the very house of Odysseus, and for me he won it. But,\\nye wooers, refrain your minds from rebukes and your hands\\nfrom buffets, that no strife and feud may arise.\\'\\n\\nSo he said, and they all bit their lips and marvelled at\\nTelemachus, in that he spake boldly. Then Antinous, son of\\nEupeithes, spake among them, saying:\\n\\n\\'Hard though the word be, let us accept it, Achaeans, even\\nthe word of Telemachus, though mightily he threatens us in\\nhis speech. For Zeus Cronion hath hindered us of our\\npurpose, else would we have silenced him in our halls,\\nshrill orator as he is.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Antinous, but Telemachus took no heed of his\\nwords. Now the henchmen were leading through the town the\\nholy hecatomb of the gods, and lo, the long-haired Achaeans\\nwere gathered beneath the shady grove of Apollo, the prince\\nof archery.\\n\\nNow when they had roasted the outer flesh and drawn it off\\nthe spits, they divided the messes and shared the glorious\\nfeast. And beside Odysseus they that waited set an equal\\nshare, the same as that which fell to themselves, for so\\nTelemachus commanded, the dear son of divine Odysseus.\\n\\nNow Athene would in nowise suffer the lordly wooers to\\nabstain from biting scorn, that the pain might sink yet the\\ndeeper into the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes. There\\nwas among the wooers a man of a lawless heart, Ctesippus\\nwas his name, and in Same was his home, who trusting,\\nforsooth, to his vast possessions, was wooing the wife of\\nOdysseus the lord long afar. And now he spake among the\\nproud wooers:\\n\\n\\'Hear me, ye lordly wooers, and I will say somewhat. The\\nstranger verily has long had his due portion, as is meet,\\nan equal share; for it is not fair nor just to rob the\\nguests of Telemachus of their right, whosoever they may be\\nthat come to this house. Go to then, I also will bestow on\\nhim a stranger\\'s gift, that he in turn may give a present\\neither to the bath-woman, or to any other of the thralls\\nwithin the house of godlike Odysseus.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he caught up an ox\\'s foot from the dish, where it\\nlay, and hurled it with strong hand. But Odysseus lightly\\navoided it with a turn of his head, and smiled right grimly\\nin his heart, and the ox\\'s foot smote the well-builded\\nwall. Then Telemachus rebuked Ctesippus, saying:\\n\\n\\'Verily, Ctesippus, it has turned out happier for thy\\nheart\\'s pleasure as it is! Thou didst not smite the\\nstranger, for he himself avoided that which was cast at\\nhim, else surely would I have struck thee through the midst\\nwith the sharp spear, and in place of wedding banquet thy\\nfather would have had to busy him about a funeral feast in\\nthis place. Wherefore let no man make show of unseemly\\ndeeds in this my house, for now I have understanding to\\ndiscern both good and evil, but in time past I was yet a\\nchild. But as needs we must, we still endure to see these\\ndeeds, while sheep are slaughtered and wine drunken and\\nbread devoured, for hard it is for one man to restrain\\nmany. But come, no longer work me harm out of an evil\\nheart; but if ye be set on slaying me, even me, with the\\nsword, even that would I rather endure, and far better\\nwould it be to die than to witness for ever these unseemly\\ndeeds--strangers shamefully entreated, and men haling the\\nhandmaidens in foul wise through the fair house.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and they were all hushed in silence. And late\\nand at last spake among them Agelaus, son of Damastor:\\n\\n\\'Friends, when a righteous word has been spoken, none\\nsurely would rebuke another with hard speech and be angry.\\nMisuse ye not this stranger, nor any of the thralls that\\nare in the house of godlike Odysseus. But to Telemachus\\nhimself I would speak a soft word and to his mother, if\\nperchance it may find favour with the mind of those twain.\\nSo long as your hearts within you had hope of the wise\\nOdysseus returning to his own house, so long none could be\\nwroth that ye waited and held back the wooers in the halls,\\nfor so had it been better, if Odysseus had returned and\\ncome back to his own home. But now the event is plain, that\\nhe will return no more. Go then, sit by thy mother and tell\\nher all, namely, that she must wed the best man that wooes\\nher, and whose gives most gifts; so shalt thou with\\ngladness live on the heritage of thy father, eating and\\ndrinking, while she cares for another\\'s house.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered, and said: \\'Nay by Zeus,\\nAgelaus, and by the griefs of my father, who far away\\nmethinks from Ithaca has perished or goes wandering, in\\nnowise do I delay my mother\\'s marriage; nay, I bid her be\\nmarried to what man she will, and withal I offer gifts\\nwithout number. But I do indeed feel shame to drive her\\nforth from the hall, despite her will, by a word of\\ncompulsion; God forbid that ever this should be.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Telemachus, but among the wooers Pallas Athene\\nroused laughter unquenchable, and drave their wits\\nwandering. And now they were laughing with alien lips, and\\nblood-bedabbled was the flesh they ate, and their eyes were\\nfilled with tears and their soul was fain of lamentation.\\nThen the godlike Theoclymenus spake among them:\\n\\n\\'Ah, wretched men, what woe is this ye suffer? Shrouded in\\nnight are your heads and your faces and your knees, and\\nkindled is the voice of wailing, and all cheeks are wet\\nwith tears, and the walls and the fair main-beams of the\\nroof are sprinkled with blood. And the porch is full, and\\nfull is the court, of ghosts that hasten hellwards beneath\\nthe gloom, and the sun has perished out of heaven, and an\\nevil mist has overspread the world.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and they all laughed sweetly at him. Then\\nEurymachus, son of Polybus, began to speak to them, saying:\\n\\n\\'The guest that is newly come from a strange land is beside\\nhimself. Quick, ye young men, and convey him forth out of\\ndoors, that he may go to the place of the gathering, since\\nhere he finds it dark as night.\\'\\n\\nThen godlike Theoclymenus answered him: \\'Eurymachus, in\\nnowise do I seek guides of thee to send me on my way. Eyes\\nhave I, and ears, and both my feet, and a stable mind in my\\nbreast of no mean fashioning. With these I will go forth,\\nfor I see evil coming on you, which not one man of the\\nwooers may avoid or shun, of all you who in the house of\\ndivine Odysseus deal insolently with men and devise\\ninfatuate deeds.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he went forth from out the fair-lying halls, and\\ncame to Peiraeus who received him gladly. Then all the\\nwooers, looking one at the other, provoked Telemachus to\\nanger, laughing at his guests. And thus some one of the\\nhaughty youths would speak:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, no man is more luckless than thou in his\\nguests, seeing thou keepest such a filthy wanderer,\\nwhosoever he be, always longing for bread and wine, and\\nskilled in no peaceful work nor any deed of war, but a mere\\nburden of the earth. And this other fellow again must stand\\nup to play the seer! Nay, but if thou wouldest listen to\\nme, much better it were. Let us cast these strangers on\\nboard a benched ship, and send them to the Sicilians,\\nwhence they would fetch thee their price.\\' {*}\\n\\n{* Reading [Greek], which is a correction. Or keeping the\\nMSS. [Greek] \\'and this should bring thee in a goodly\\nprice,\\' the subject to [Greek] being, probably, THE SALE,\\nwhich is suggested by the context.}\\n\\nSo spake the wooers, but he heeded not their words, in\\nsilence he looked towards his father, expecting evermore\\nthe hour when he should stretch forth his hands upon the\\nshameless wooers.\\n\\nNow the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had set her\\nfair chair over against them, and heard the words of each\\none of the men in the halls. For in the midst of laughter\\nthey had got ready the midday meal, a sweet meal and\\nabundant, for they had sacrificed many cattle. But never\\ncould there be a banquet less gracious than that supper,\\nsuch an one as the goddess and the brave man were soon to\\nspread for them; for that they had begun the devices of\\nshame.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XXI\\n\\n  Penelope bringeth forth her husband\\'s bow, which the\\n  suitors could not bend, but was bent by Odysseus.\\n\\nNow the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put it into the heart of\\nthe daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, to set the bow and\\nthe axes of grey iron, for the wooers in the halls of\\nOdysseus, to be the weapons of the contest, and the\\nbeginning of death. So she descended the tall staircase of\\nher chamber, and took the well-bent key in her strong hand,\\na goodly key of bronze, whereon was a handle of ivory. And\\nshe betook her, with her handmaidens, to the\\ntreasure-chamber in the uttermost part of the house, where\\nlay the treasures of her lord, bronze and gold and\\nwell-wrought iron. And there lay the back-bent bow and the\\nquiver for the arrows, and many shafts were therein, winged\\nfor death, gifts of a friend of Odysseus, that met with him\\nin Lacedaemon, Iphitus son of Eurytus, a man like to the\\ngods. These twain fell in with one another in Messene, in\\nthe house of wise Ortilochus. Now Odysseus had gone thither\\nto recover somewhat that was owing to him from all the\\npeople, for the men of Messene had lifted three hundred\\nsheep in benched ships from out of Ithaca, with the\\nshepherds of the flock. In quest of these it was that\\nOdysseus went on a far embassy, being yet a lad; for his\\nfather and the other elders sent him forth. Moreover,\\nIphitus came thither in his search for twelve brood mares,\\nwhich he had lost, with sturdy mules at the teat. These\\nsame it was that brought him death and destiny in the\\nlatter end, when he came to the child of Zeus, hardy of\\nheart, the man Heracles, that had knowledge of great\\nadventures, who smote Iphitus though his guest in his\\nhouse, in his frowardness, and had no regard for the\\nvengeance of the gods, nor for the table which he spread\\nbefore him; for after the meal he slew him, his guest\\nthough he was, and kept for himself in the halls the horses\\nstrong of hoof. After these was Iphitus asking, when he met\\nwith Odysseus, and he gave him the bow, which of old great\\nEurytus bare and had left at his death to his son in his\\nlofty house. And Odysseus gave Iphitus a sharp sword and a\\nmighty spear, for the beginning of a loving friendship; but\\nnever had they acquaintance one of another at the board;\\nere that might be, the son of Zeus slew Iphitus son of\\nEurytus, a man like to the immortals, the same that gave\\nOdysseus the bow. But goodly Odysseus would never take it\\nwith him on the black ships, as he went to the wars, but\\nthe bow was laid by at home in the halls as a memorial of a\\ndear guest, and he carried it on his own land.\\n\\nNow when the fair lady had come even to the\\ntreasure-chamber, and had stept upon the threshold of oak,\\nwhich the carpenter had on a time planed cunningly, and\\nover it had made straight the line,--doorposts also had he\\nfitted thereby, whereon he set shining doors,--anon she\\nquickly loosed the strap from the handle of the door, and\\nthrust in the key, and with a straight aim shot back the\\nbolts. And even as a bull roars that is grazing in a\\nmeadow, so mightily roared the fair doors smitten by the\\nkey; and speedily they flew open before her. Then she stept\\non to the high floor, where the coffers stood, wherein the\\nfragrant raiment was stored. Thence she stretched forth her\\nhand, and took the bow from off the pin, all in the bright\\ncase which sheathed it around. And there she sat down, and\\nset the case upon her knees, and cried aloud and wept, and\\ntook out the bow of her lord. Now when she had her fill of\\ntearful lament, she set forth to go to the hall to the\\ncompany of the proud wooers, with the back-bent bow in her\\nhands, and the quiver for the arrows, and many shafts were\\ntherein winged for death. And her maidens along with her\\nbare a chest, wherein lay much store of iron and bronze,\\nthe gear of combat of their lord. Now when the fair lady\\nhad come unto the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the\\nwell-builded roof, holding up her glistening tire before\\nher face; and a faithful maiden stood on either side of\\nher, and straightway she spake out among the wooers and\\ndeclared her word, saying:\\n\\n\\'Hear me, ye lordly wooers, who have vexed this house, that\\nye might eat and drink here evermore, forasmuch as the\\nmaster is long gone, nor could ye find any other mark {*}\\nfor your speech, but all your desire was to wed me and take\\nme to wife. Nay come now, ye wooers, seeing that this is\\nthe prize that is put before you. I will set forth for you\\nthe great bow of divine Odysseus, and whoso shall most\\neasily string the bow in his hands, and shoot through all\\ntwelve axes, with him will I go and forsake this house,\\nthis house of my wedlock, so fair and filled with all\\nlivelihood, which methinks I shall yet remember, aye, in a\\ndream.\\'\\n\\n{* The accepted interpretation of [Greek] (a word which\\noccurs only here) is \\'pretext\\'; but this does not agree\\nwith any of the meanings of the verb from which the noun is\\nderived. The usage of [Greek] in Od. xix. 71, xxii. 75, of\\n[Greek] in Il. xvii. 465, and of [Greek] in Od. xxii. 15,\\nsuggests rather for [Greek] the idea of \\'aiming at a\\nmark.\\'}\\n\\nSo spake she, and commanded Eumaeus, the goodly swineherd,\\nto set the bow for the wooers and the axes of grey iron.\\nAnd Eumaeus took them with tears, and laid them down; and\\notherwhere the neatherd wept, when he beheld the bow of his\\nlord. Then Antinous rebuked them, and spake and hailed\\nthem:\\n\\n\\'Foolish boors, whose thoughts look not beyond the day, ah,\\nwretched pair, wherefore now do ye shed tears, and stir the\\nsoul of the lady within her, when her heart already lies\\nlow in pain, for that she has lost her dear lord? Nay sit,\\nand feast in silence, or else get ye forth and weep, and\\nleave the bow here behind, to be a terrible contest for the\\nwooers, for methinks that this polished bow does not\\nlightly yield itself to be strung. For there is no man\\namong all these present such as Odysseus was, and I myself\\nsaw him, yea I remember it well, though I was still but a\\nchild.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, but his heart within him hoped that he would\\nstring the bow, and shoot through the iron. Yet verily, he\\nwas to be the first that should taste the arrow at the\\nhands of the noble Odysseus, whom but late he was\\ndishonouring as he sat in the halls, and was inciting all\\nhis fellows to do likewise.\\n\\nThen the mighty prince Telemachus spake among them, saying:\\n\\'Lo now, in very truth, Cronion has robbed me of my wits!\\nMy dear mother, wise as she is, declares that she will go\\nwith a stranger and forsake this house; yet I laugh and in\\nmy silly heart I am glad. Nay come now, ye wooers, seeing\\nthat this is the prize which is set before you, a lady, the\\nlike of whom there is not now in the Achaean land, neither\\nin sacred Pylos, nor in Argos, nor in Mycenae, nor yet in\\nIthaca, nor in the dark mainland. Nay but ye know all this\\nyourselves,--why need I praise my mother? Come therefore,\\ndelay not the issue with excuses, nor hold much longer\\naloof from the drawing of the bow, that we may see the\\nthing that is to be. Yea and I myself would make trial of\\nthis bow. If I shall string it, and shoot through the iron,\\nthen should I not sorrow if my lady mother were to quit\\nthese halls and go with a stranger, seeing that I should be\\nleft behind, well able now to lift my father\\'s goodly gear\\nof combat.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he cast from off his neck his cloak of scarlet,\\nand sprang to his full height, and put away the sword from\\nhis shoulders. First he dug a good trench and set up the\\naxes, one long trench for them all, and over it he made\\nstraight the line and round about stamped in the earth. And\\namazement fell on all that beheld how orderly he set the\\naxes, though never before had he seen it so. Then he went\\nand stood by the threshold and began to prove the bow.\\nThrice he made it to tremble in his great desire to draw\\nit, and thrice he rested from his effort, though still he\\nhoped in his heart to string the bow, and shoot through the\\niron. And now at last he might have strung it, mightily\\nstraining thereat for the fourth time, but Odysseus nodded\\nfrowning and stayed him, for all his eagerness. Then the\\nstrong prince Telemachus spake among them again:\\n\\n\\'Lo you now, even to the end of my days I shall be a coward\\nand a weakling, or it may be I am too young, and have as\\nyet no trust in my hands to defend me from such an one as\\ndoes violence without a cause. But come now, ye who are\\nmightier men than I, essay the bow and let us make an end\\nof the contest.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he put the bow from him on the ground, leaning it\\nagainst the smooth and well-compacted doors, and the swift\\nshaft he propped hard by against the fair bow-tip, and then\\nhe sat down once more on the high seat, whence he had\\nrisen.\\n\\nThen Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spake among them, saying:\\n\\'Rise up in order, all my friends, beginning from the left,\\neven from the place whence the wine is poured.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Antinous, and the saying pleased them well. Then\\nfirst stood up Leiodes, son of Oenops, who was their\\nsoothsayer and ever sat by the fair mixing bowl at the\\nextremity of the hall; he alone hated their infatuate deeds\\nand was indignant with all the wooers. He now first took\\nthe bow and the swift shaft, and he went and stood by the\\nthreshold, and began to prove the bow; but he could not\\nbend it; or ever that might be, his hands grew weary with\\nthe straining, his unworn, delicate hands; so he spake\\namong the wooers, saying:\\n\\n\\'Friends, of a truth I cannot bend it, let some other take\\nit. Ah, many of our bravest shall this bow rob of spirit\\nand of life, since truly it is far better for us to die,\\nthan to live on and to fail of that for which we assemble\\nevermore in this place, day by day expecting the prize.\\nMany there be even now that hope in their hearts and desire\\nto wed Penelope, the bedfellow of Odysseus: but when such\\nan one shall make trial of the bow and see the issue,\\nthereafter let him woo some other fair-robed Achaean woman\\nwith his bridal gifts and seek to win her. So may our lady\\nwed the man that gives most gifts, and comes as the chosen\\nof fate.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and put from him the bow leaning it against\\nthe smooth and well-compacted doors, and the swift shaft he\\npropped hard by against the fair bow-tip, and then he sat\\ndown once more on the high seat, whence he had risen.\\n\\nBut Antinous rebuked him, and spake and hailed him:\\n\\'Leiodes, what word hath escaped the door of thy lips; a\\nhard word, and a grievous? Nay, it angers me to hear it,\\nand to think that a bow such as this shall rob our bravest\\nof spirit and of life, and all because thou canst not draw\\nit. For I tell thee that thy lady mother bare thee not of\\nsuch might as to draw a bow and shoot arrows: but there be\\nothers of the proud wooers that shall draw it soon.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and commanded Melanthius, the goatherd,\\nsaying: \\'Up now, light a fire in the halls, Melanthius; and\\nplace a great settle by the fire and a fleece thereon, and\\nbring forth a great ball of lard that is within, that we\\nyoung men may warm and anoint the bow therewith and prove\\nit, and make an end of the contest.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and Melanthius soon kindled the never-resting\\nfire, and drew up a settle and placed it near, and put a\\nfleece thereon, and he brought forth a great ball of lard\\nthat was within. Therewith the young men warmed the bow,\\nand made essay, but could not string it, for they were\\ngreatly lacking of such might. And Antinous still held to\\nthe task and godlike Eurymachus, chief men among the\\nwooers, who were far the most excellent of all.\\n\\nBut those other twain went forth both together from the\\nhouse, the neatherd and the swineherd of godlike Odysseus;\\nand Odysseus passed out after them. But when they were now\\ngotten without the gates and the courtyard, he uttered his\\nvoice and spake to them in gentle words:\\n\\n\\'Neatherd and thou swineherd, shall I say somewhat or keep\\nit to myself? Nay, my spirit bids me declare it. What\\nmanner of men would ye be to help Odysseus, if he should\\ncome thus suddenly, I know not whence, and some god were to\\nbring him? Would ye stand on the side of the wooers or of\\nOdysseus? Tell me even as your heart and spirit bid you.\\'\\n\\nThen the neatherd answered him, saying: \\'Father Zeus, if\\nbut thou wouldst fulfil this wish: {*}--oh, that that man\\nmight come, and some god lead him hither! So shouldest thou\\nknow what my might is, and how my hands follow to obey.\\'\\n\\n{* Placing a colon at [Greek]}\\n\\nIn like manner Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that wise\\nOdysseus might return to his own home.\\n\\nNow when he knew for a surety what spirit they were of,\\nonce more he answered and spake to them, saying:\\n\\n\\'Behold, home am I come, even I; after much travail and\\nsore am I come in the twentieth year to mine own country.\\nAnd I know how that my coming is desired by you alone of\\nall my thralls, for from none besides have I heard a prayer\\nthat I might return once more to my home. And now I will\\ntell you all the truth, even as it shall come to pass. If\\nthe god shall subdue the proud wooers to my hands, I will\\nbring you each one a wife, and will give you a heritage of\\nyour own and a house builded near to me, and ye twain shall\\nbe thereafter in mine eyes as the brethren and companions\\nof Telemachus. But behold, I will likewise show you a most\\nmanifest token, that ye may know me well and be certified\\nin heart, even the wound that the boar dealt me with his\\nwhite tusk long ago, when I went to Parnassus with the sons\\nof Autolycus.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he drew aside the rags from the great scar. And\\nwhen the twain had beheld it and marked it well, they cast\\ntheir arms about the wise Odysseus, and fell a weeping; and\\nkissed him lovingly on head and shoulders. And in like\\nmanner Odysseus too kissed their heads and hands. And now\\nwould the sunlight have gone down upon their sorrowing, had\\nnot Odysseus himself stayed them saying:\\n\\n\\'Cease ye from weeping and lamentation, lest some one come\\nforth from the hall and see us, and tell it likewise in the\\nhouse. Nay, go ye within one by one and not both together,\\nI first and you following, and let this be the token\\nbetween us. All the rest, as many as are proud wooers, will\\nnot suffer that I should be given the bow and quiver; do\\nthou then, goodly Eumaeus, as thou bearest the bow through\\nthe hall, set it in my hands and speak to the women that\\nthey bar the well-fitting doors of their chamber. And if\\nany of them hear the sound of groaning or the din of men\\nwithin our walls, let them not run forth but abide where\\nthey are in silence at their work. But on thee, goodly\\nPhiloetius, I lay this charge, to bolt and bar the outer\\ngate of the court and swiftly to tie the knot.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he passed within the fair-lying halls, and went\\nand sat upon the settle whence he had risen. And likewise\\nthe two thralls of divine Odysseus went within.\\n\\nAnd now Eurymachus was handling the bow, warming it on this\\nside and on that at the light of the fire; yet even so he\\ncould not string it, and in his great heart he groaned\\nmightily; and in heaviness of spirit he spake and called\\naloud, saying:\\n\\n\\'Lo you now, truly am I grieved for myself and for you all!\\nNot for the marriage do I mourn so greatly, afflicted\\nthough I be; there are many Achaean women besides, some in\\nsea-begirt Ithaca itself and some in other cities. Nay, but\\nI grieve, if indeed we are so far worse than godlike\\nOdysseus in might, seeing that we cannot bend the bow. It\\nwill be a shame even for men unborn to hear thereof.\\'\\n\\nThen Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: \\'Eurymachus,\\nthis shall not be so, and thou thyself too knowest it. For\\nto-day the feast of the archer god is held in the land, a\\nholy feast. Who at such a time would be bending bows? Nay,\\nset it quietly by; what and if we should let the axes all\\nstand as they are? None methinks will come to the hall of\\nOdysseus, son of Laertes, and carry them away. Go to now,\\nlet the wine-bearer pour for libation into each cup in\\nturn, that after the drink-offering we may set down the\\ncurved bow. And in the morning bid Melanthius, the\\ngoatherd, to lead hither the very best goats in all his\\nherds, that we may lay pieces of the thighs on the altar of\\nApollo the archer, and assay the bow and make an end of the\\ncontest.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Antinous, and the saying pleased them well. Then\\nthe henchmen poured water on their hands, and pages crowned\\nthe mixing-bowls with drink, and served out the wine to\\nall, when they had poured for libation into each cup in\\nturn. But when they had poured forth and had drunken to\\ntheir hearts\\' desire, Odysseus of many counsels spake among\\nthem out of a crafty heart, saying:\\n\\n\\'Hear me, ye wooers of the renowned queen, that I may say\\nthat which my heart within me bids. And mainly to\\nEurymachus I make my prayer and to the godlike Antinous,\\nforasmuch as he has spoken even this word aright, namely,\\nthat for this present ye cease from your archery and leave\\nthe issue to the gods; and in the morning the god will give\\nthe victory to whomsoever he will. Come therefore, give me\\nthe polished bow, that in your presence I may prove my\\nhands and strength, whether I have yet any force such as\\nonce was in my supple limbs, or whether my wanderings and\\nneedy fare have even now destroyed it.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he and they all were exceeding wroth, for fear\\nlest he should string the polished bow. And Antinous\\nrebuked him, and spake and hailed him:\\n\\n\\'Wretched stranger, thou hast no wit, nay never so little.\\nArt thou not content to feast at ease in our high company,\\nand to lack not thy share of the banquet, but to listen to\\nour speech and our discourse, while no guest and beggar\\nbeside thee hears our speech? Wine it is that wounds thee,\\nhoney sweet wine, that is the bane of others too, even of\\nall who take great draughts and drink out of measure. Wine\\nit was that darkened the mind even of the Centaur, renowned\\nEurytion, in the hall of high-hearted Peirithous, when he\\nwent to the Lapithae; and after that his heart was darkened\\nwith wine, he wrought foul deeds in his frenzy, in the\\nhouse of Peirithous. Then wrath fell on all the heroes, and\\nthey leaped up and dragged him forth through the porch,\\nwhen they had shorn off his ears and nostrils with the\\npitiless sword, and then with darkened mind he bare about\\nwith him the burden of his sin in foolishness of heart.\\nThence was the feud begun between the Centaurs and mankind;\\nbut first for himself gat he hurt, being heavy with wine.\\nAnd even so I declare great mischief unto thee if thou\\nshalt string the bow, for thou shalt find no courtesy at\\nthe hand of anyone in our land, and anon we will send thee\\nin a black ship to Echetus, the maimer of all men, and\\nthence thou shalt not be saved alive. Nay then, drink at\\nthine ease, and strive not still with men that are younger\\nthan thou.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him: \\'Antinous, truly it is not\\nfair nor just to rob the guests of Telemachus of their due,\\nwhosoever he may be that comes to this house. Dost thou\\nthink if yonder stranger strings the great bow of Odysseus,\\nin the pride of his might and of his strength of arm, that\\nhe will lead me to his home and make me his wife? Nay he\\nhimself, methinks, has no such hope in his breast; so, as\\nfor that, let not any of you fret himself while feasting in\\nthis place; that were indeed unmeet.\\'\\n\\nThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered her, saying:\\n\\'Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, it is not that we deem\\nthat he will lead thee to his home,--far be such a thought\\nfrom us,--but we dread the speech of men and women, lest\\nsome day one of the baser sort among the Achaeans say:\\n\"Truly men far too mean are wooing the wife of one that is\\nnoble, nor can they string the polished bow. But a stranger\\nand a beggar came in his wanderings, and lightly strung the\\nbow, and shot through the iron.\" Thus will they speak, and\\nthis will turn to our reproach.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him: \\'Eurymachus, never can\\nthere be fair fame in the land for those that devour and\\ndishonour the house of a prince, but why make ye this thing\\ninto a reproach? But, behold, our guest is great of growth\\nand well-knit, and avows him to be born the son of a good\\nfather. Come then, give ye him the polished bow, that we\\nmay see that which is to be. For thus will I declare my\\nsaying, and it shall surely come to pass. If he shall\\nstring the bow and Apollo grant him renown, I will clothe\\nhim in a mantle and a doublet, goodly raiment, and I will\\ngive him a sharp javelin to defend him against dogs and\\nmen, and a two-edged sword and sandals to bind beneath his\\nfeet, and I will send him whithersoever his heart and\\nspirit bid him go.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered her, saying: \\'My mother, as\\nfor the bow, no Achaean is mightier than I to give or to\\ndeny it to whomso I will, neither as many as are lords in\\nrocky Ithaca nor in the isles on the side of Elis, the\\npastureland of horses. Not one of these shall force me in\\nmine own despite, if I choose to give this bow, yea once\\nand for all, to the stranger to bear away with him. But do\\nthou go to thine own chamber and mind thine own\\nhousewiferies, the loom and distaff, and bid thine\\nhandmaids ply their tasks. But the bow shall be for men,\\nfor all, but for me in chief, for mine is the lordship in\\nthe house.\\'\\n\\nThen in amaze she went back to her chamber, for she laid up\\nthe wise saying of her son in her heart. She ascended to\\nher upper chamber with the women her handmaids, and then\\nwas bewailing Odysseus, her dear lord, till grey-eyed\\nAthene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\\n\\nNow the goodly swineherd had taken the curved bow, and was\\nbearing it, when the wooers all cried out upon him in the\\nhalls. And thus some one of the haughty youths would speak:\\n\\'Whither now art thou bearing the curved bow, thou wretched\\nswineherd, crazed in thy wits? Lo, soon shall the swift\\nhounds of thine own breeding eat thee hard by thy swine,\\nalone and away from men, if Apollo will be gracious to us\\nand the other deathless gods.\\'\\n\\nEven so they spake, and he took and set down the bow in\\nthat very place, being affrighted because many cried out on\\nhim in the halls. Then Telemachus from the other side spake\\nthreateningly, and called aloud:\\n\\n\\'Father, bring hither the bow, soon shalt thou rue it that\\nthou servest many masters. Take heed, lest I that am\\nyounger than thou pursue thee to the field, and pelt thee\\nwith stones, for in might I am the better. If only I were\\nso much mightier in strength of arm than all the wooers\\nthat are in the halls, soon would I send many an one forth\\non a woeful way from out our house, for they imagine\\nmischief against us.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and all the wooers laughed sweetly at him, and\\nceased now from their cruel anger toward Telemachus. Then\\nthe swineherd bare the bow through the hall, and went up to\\nwise Odysseus, and set it in his hands. And he called forth\\nthe nurse Eurycleia from the chamber and spake to her:\\n\\n\\'Wise Eurycleia, Telemachus bids thee bar the well-fitting\\ndoors of thy chamber, and if any of the women hear the\\nsound of groaning or the din of men within our walls, let\\nthem not go forth, but abide where they are in silence at\\ntheir work.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and wingless her speech remained, and she\\nbarred the doors of the fair-lying chambers.\\n\\nThen Philoetius hasted forth silently from the house, and\\nbarred the outer gates of the fenced court. Now there lay\\nbeneath the gallery the cable of a curved ship, fashioned\\nof the byblus plant, wherewith he made fast the gates, and\\nthen himself passed within. Then he went and sat on the\\nsettle whence he had risen, and gazed upon Odysseus. He\\nalready was handling the bow, turning it every way about,\\nand proving it on this side and on that, lest the worms\\nmight have eaten the horns when the lord of the bow was\\naway. And thus men spake looking each one to his neighbour:\\n\\n\\'Verily he has a good eye, and a shrewd turn for a bow!\\nEither, methinks, he himself has such a bow lying by at\\nhome or else he is set on making one, in such wise does he\\nturn it hither and thither in his hands, this evil-witted\\nbeggar.\\'\\n\\nAnd another again of the haughty youths would say: \\'Would\\nthat the fellow may have profit thereof, just so surely as\\nhe shall ever prevail to bend this bow!\\'\\n\\nSo spake the wooers, but Odysseus of many counsels had\\nlifted the great bow and viewed it on every side, and even\\nas when a man that is skilled in the lyre and in\\nminstrelsy, easily stretches a cord about a new peg, after\\ntying at either end the twisted sheep-gut, even so Odysseus\\nstraightway bent the great bow, all without effort, and\\ntook it in his right hand and proved the bow-string, which\\nrang sweetly at the touch, in tone like a swallow. Then\\ngreat grief came upon the wooers, and the colour of their\\ncountenance was changed, and Zeus thundered loud showing\\nforth his tokens. And the steadfast goodly Odysseus was\\nglad thereat, in that the son of deep-counselling Cronos\\nhad sent him a sign. Then he caught up a swift arrow which\\nlay by his table, bare, but the other shafts were stored\\nwithin the hollow quiver, those whereof the Achaeans were\\nsoon to taste. He took and laid it on the bridge of the\\nbow, and held the notch and drew the string, even from the\\nsettle whereon he sat, and with straight aim shot the shaft\\nand missed not one of the axes, beginning from the first\\naxe-handle, and the bronze-weighted shaft passed clean\\nthrough and out at the last. Then he spake to Telemachus,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, thy guest that sits in the halls does thee no\\nshame. In nowise did I miss my mark, nor was I wearied with\\nlong bending of the bow. Still is my might steadfast--not\\nas the wooers say scornfully to slight me. But now is it\\ntime that supper too be got ready for the Achaeans, while\\nit is yet light, and thereafter must we make other sport\\nwith the dance and the lyre, for these are the crown of the\\nfeast.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he nodded with bent brows, and Telemachus, the\\ndear son of divine Odysseus, girt his sharp sword about him\\nand took the spear in his grasp, and stood by his high seat\\nat his father\\'s side, armed with the gleaming bronze.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XXII\\n\\n  The killing of the wooers.\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels stripped him of his rags and\\nleaped on to the great threshold with his bow and quiver\\nfull of arrows, and poured forth all the swift shafts there\\nbefore his feet, and spake among the wooers:\\n\\n\\'Lo, now is this terrible trial ended at last; and now will\\nI know of another mark, which never yet man has smitten, if\\nperchance I may hit it and Apollo grant me renown.\\'\\n\\nWith that he pointed the bitter arrow at Antinous. Now he\\nwas about raising to his lips a fair twy-eared chalice of\\ngold, and behold, he was handling it to drink of the wine,\\nand death was far from his thoughts. For who among men at\\nfeast would deem that one man amongst so many, how hardy\\nsoever he were, would bring on him foul death and black\\nfate? But Odysseus aimed and smote him with the arrow in\\nthe throat, and the point passed clean out through his\\ndelicate neck, and he fell sidelong and the cup dropped\\nfrom his hand as he was smitten, and at once through his\\nnostrils there came up a thick jet of slain man\\'s blood,\\nand quickly he spurned the table from him with his foot,\\nand spilt the food on the ground, and the bread and the\\nroast flesh were defiled. Then the wooers raised a clamour\\nthrough the halls when they saw the man fallen, and they\\nleaped from their high seats, as men stirred by fear, all\\nthrough the hall, peering everywhere along the well-builded\\nwalls, and nowhere was there a shield or mighty spear to\\nlay hold on. Then they reviled Odysseus with angry words:\\n\\n\\'Stranger, thou shootest at men to thy hurt. Never again\\nshalt thou enter other lists, now is utter doom assured\\nthee. Yea, for now hast thou slain the man that was far the\\nbest of all the noble youths in Ithaca; wherefore vultures\\nshall devour thee here.\\'\\n\\nSo each one spake, for indeed they thought that Odysseus\\nhad not slain him wilfully; but they knew not in their\\nfolly that on their own heads, each and all of them, the\\nbands of death had been made fast. Then Odysseus of many\\ncounsels looked fiercely on them, and spake:\\n\\n\\'Ye dogs, ye said in your hearts that I should never more\\ncome home from the land of the Trojans, in that ye wasted\\nmy house, and lay with the maidservants by force, and\\ntraitorously wooed my wife while I was yet alive, and ye\\nhad no fear of the gods, that hold the wide heaven, nor of\\nthe indignation of men hereafter. But now the bands of\\ndeath have been made fast upon you one and all.\\'\\n\\nEven so he spake, and pale fear gat hold on the limbs of\\nall, and each man looked about, where he might shun utter\\ndoom. And Eurymachus alone answered him, and spake: \\'If\\nthou art indeed Odysseus of Ithaca, come home again, with\\nright thou speakest thus, of all that the Achaeans have\\nwrought, many infatuate deeds in thy halls and many in the\\nfield. Howbeit, he now lies dead that is to blame for all,\\nAntinous; for he brought all these things upon us, not as\\nlonging very greatly for the marriage nor needing it sore,\\nbut with another purpose, that Cronion has not fulfilled\\nfor him, namely, that he might himself be king over all the\\nland of stablished Ithaca, and he was to have lain in wait\\nfor thy son and killed him. But now he is slain after his\\ndeserving, and do thou spare thy people, even thine own;\\nand we will hereafter go about the township and yield thee\\namends for all that has been eaten and drunken in thy\\nhalls, each for himself bringing atonement of twenty oxen\\nworth, and requiting thee in gold and bronze till thy heart\\nis softened, but till then none may blame thee that thou\\nart angry.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on him, and\\nsaid: \\'Eurymachus, not even if ye gave me all your\\nheritage, all that ye now have, and whatsoever else ye\\nmight in any wise add thereto, not even so would I\\nhenceforth hold my hands from slaying, ere the wooers had\\npaid for all their transgressions. And now the choice lies\\nbefore you, whether to fight in fair battle or to fly, if\\nany may avoid death and the fates. But there be some,\\nmethinks, that shall not escape from utter doom.\\'\\n\\nHe spake, and their knees were straightway loosened and\\ntheir hearts melted within them. And Eurymachus spake among\\nthem yet again:\\n\\n\\'Friends, it is plain that this man will not hold his\\nunconquerable hands, but now that he has caught up the\\npolished bow and quiver, he will shoot from the smooth\\nthreshold, till he has slain us all; wherefore let us take\\nthought for the delight of battle. Draw your blades, and\\nhold up the tables to ward off the arrows of swift death,\\nand let us all have at him with one accord, and drive him,\\nif it may be, from the threshold and the doorway and then\\ngo through the city, and quickly would the cry be raised.\\nThereby should this man soon have shot his latest bolt.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he drew his sharp two-edged sword of bronze, and\\nleapt on Odysseus with a terrible cry, but in the same\\nmoment goodly Odysseus shot the arrow forth and struck him\\non the breast by the pap, and drave the swift shaft into\\nhis liver. So he let the sword fall from his hand, and\\ngrovelling over the table he bowed and fell, and spilt the\\nfood and the two-handled cup on the floor. And in his agony\\nhe smote the ground with his brow, and spurning with both\\nhis feet he overthrew the high seat, and the mist of death\\nwas shed upon his eyes.\\n\\nThen Amphinomus made at renowned Odysseus, setting straight\\nat him, and drew his sharp sword, if perchance he might\\nmake him give ground from the door. But Telemachus was\\nbeforehand with him, and cast and smote him from behind\\nwith a bronze-shod spear between the shoulders, and drave\\nit out through the breast, and he fell with a crash and\\nstruck the ground full with his forehead. Then Telemachus\\nsprang away, leaving the long spear fixed in Amphinomus,\\nfor he greatly dreaded lest one of the Achaeans might run\\nupon him with his blade, and stab him as he drew forth the\\nspear, or smite him with a down stroke {*} of the sword. So\\nhe started and ran and came quickly to his father, and\\nstood by him, and spake winged words:\\n\\n{* Or, reading [Greek], smite him as he stooped over the\\ncorpse.}\\n\\n\\'Father, lo, now I will bring thee a shield and two spears\\nand a helmet all of bronze, close fitting on the temples,\\nand when I return I will arm myself, and likewise give arms\\nto the swineherd and to the neatherd yonder: for it is\\nbetter to be clad in full armour.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: \\'Run and\\nbring them while I have arrows to defend me, lest they\\nthrust me from the doorway, one man against them all.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and Telemachus obeyed his dear father, and\\nwent forth to the chamber, where his famous weapons were\\nlying. Thence he took out four shields and eight spears,\\nand four helmets of bronze, with thick plumes of horse\\nhair, and he started to bring them and came quickly to his\\nfather. Now he girded the gear of bronze about his own body\\nfirst, and in like manner the two thralls did on the goodly\\narmour, and stood beside the wise and crafty Odysseus. Now\\nhe, so long as he had arrows to defend him, kept aiming and\\nsmote the wooers one by one in his house, and they fell\\nthick one upon another. But when the arrows failed the\\nprince in his archery, he leaned his bow against the\\ndoorpost of the stablished hall, against the shining faces\\nof the entrance. As for him he girt his fourfold shield\\nabout his shoulders and bound on his mighty head a well\\nwrought helmet, with horse hair crest, and terribly the\\nplume waved aloft. And he grasped two mighty spears tipped\\nwith bronze.\\n\\nNow there was in the well-builded wall a certain postern\\nraised above the floor, and there by the topmost level of\\nthe threshold of the stablished hall, was a way into an\\nopen passage, closed by well-fitted folding doors. So\\nOdysseus bade the goodly swineherd stand near thereto and\\nwatch the way, for thither there was but one approach. Then\\nAgelaus spake among them, and declared his word to all:\\n\\n\\'Friends, will not some man climb up to the postern, and\\ngive word to the people, and a cry would be raised\\nstraightway; so should this man soon have shot his latest\\nbolt?\\'\\n\\nThen Melanthius, the goatherd, answered him, saying: \\'It\\nmay in no wise be, prince Agelaus; for the fair gate of the\\ncourtyard is terribly nigh, and perilous is the entrance to\\nthe passage, and one man, if he were valiant, might keep\\nback a host. But come, let me bring you armour from the\\ninner chamber, that ye may be clad in hauberks, for,\\nmethinks, within that room and not elsewhere did Odysseus\\nand his renowned son lay by the arms.\\'\\n\\nTherewith Melanthius, the goatherd, climbed up by the\\nclerestory of the hall to the inner chambers of Odysseus,\\nwhence he took twelve shields and as many spears, and as\\nmany helmets of bronze with thick plumes of horse hair, and\\nhe came forth and brought them speedily, and gave them to\\nthe wooers. Then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and\\nhis heart melted within him, when he saw them girding on\\nthe armour and brandishing the long spears in their hands,\\nand great, he saw, was the adventure. Quickly he spake to\\nTelemachus winged words:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, sure I am that one of the women in the halls\\nis stirring up an evil battle against us, or perchance it\\nis Melanthius.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him: \\'My father, it is I that\\nhave erred herein and none other is to blame, for I left\\nthe well-fitted door of the chamber open, and there has\\nbeen one of them but too quick to spy it. Go now, goodly\\nEumaeus, and close the door of the chamber, and mark if it\\nbe indeed one of the women that does this mischief, or\\nMelanthius, son of Dolius, as methinks it is.\\'\\n\\nEven so they spake one to the other. And Melanthius, the\\ngoatherd, went yet again to the chamber to bring the fair\\narmour. But the goodly swineherd was ware thereof, and\\nquickly he spake to Odysseus who stood nigh him:\\n\\n\\'Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus, of many\\ndevices, lo, there again is that baleful man, whom we\\nourselves suspect, going to the chamber; do thou tell me\\ntruly, shall I slay him if I prove the better man, or bring\\nhim hither to thee, that he may pay for the many\\ntransgressions that he has devised in thy house?\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered saying: \\'Verily, I\\nand Telemachus will keep the proud wooers within the halls,\\nfor all their fury, but do ye twain tie his feet and arms\\nbehind his back and cast him into the chamber, and close\\nthe doors after you,{*} and make fast to his body a twisted\\nrope, and drag him up the lofty pillar till he be near the\\nroof beams, that he may hang there and live for long, and\\nsuffer grievous torment.\\'\\n\\n{* Or, as Mr. Merry suggests in his note, \\'tie boards\\nbehind him\\' as a method of torture. He compares Aristoph.\\nThesm. 931,940.}\\n\\nSo he spake, and they gave good heed and hearkened. So they\\nwent forth to the chamber, but the goatherd who was within\\nknew not of their coming. Now he was seeking for the armour\\nin the secret place of the chamber, but they twain stood in\\nwaiting on either side the doorposts. And when Melanthius,\\nthe goatherd, was crossing the threshold with a goodly helm\\nin one hand, and in the other a wide shield and an old,\\nstained with rust, the shield of the hero Laertes that he\\nbare when he was young--but at that time it was laid by,\\nand the seams of the straps were loosened,--then the twain\\nrushed on him and caught him, and dragged him in by the\\nhair, and cast him on the floor in sorrowful plight, and\\nbound him hand and foot in a bitter bond, tightly winding\\neach limb behind his back, even as the son of Laertes bade\\nthem, the steadfast goodly Odysseus. And they made fast to\\nhis body a twisted rope, and dragged him up the lofty\\npillar till he came near the roof beams. Then didst thou\\nspeak to him and gird at him, swineherd Eumaeus:\\n\\n\\'Now in good truth, Melanthius, shalt thou watch all night,\\nlying in a soft bed as beseems thee, nor shall the\\nearly-born Dawn escape thy ken, when she comes forth from\\nthe streams of Oceanus, on her golden throne, in the hour\\nwhen thou art wont to drive the goats to make a meal for\\nthe wooers in the halls.\\'\\n\\nSo he was left there, stretched tight in the deadly bond.\\nBut they twain got into their harness, and closed the\\nshining door, and went to Odysseus, wise and crafty chief.\\nThere they stood breathing fury, four men by the threshold,\\nwhile those others within the halls were many and good\\nwarriors. Then Athene, daughter of Zeus, drew nigh them,\\nlike Mentor in fashion and in voice, and Odysseus was glad\\nwhen he saw her and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Mentor, ward from us hurt, and remember me thy dear\\ncompanion, that befriended thee often, and thou art of like\\nage with me.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, deeming the while that it was Athene, summoner\\nof the host. But the wooers on the other side shouted in\\nthe halls, and first Agelaus son of Damastor rebuked\\nAthene, saying:\\n\\n\\'Mentor, let not the speech of Odysseus beguile thee to\\nfight against the wooers, and to succour him. For methinks\\nthat on this wise we shall work our will. When we shall\\nhave slain these men, father and son, thereafter shalt thou\\nperish with them, such deeds thou art set on doing in these\\nhalls; nay, with thine own head shalt thou pay the price.\\nBut when with the sword we shall have overcome your\\nviolence, we will mingle all thy possessions, all that thou\\nhast at home or in the field, with the wealth of Odysseus,\\nand we will not suffer thy sons nor thy daughters to dwell\\nin the halls, nor thy good wife to gad about in the town of\\nIthaca.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and Athene was mightily angered at heart, and\\nchid Odysseus in wrathful words: \\'Odysseus, thou hast no\\nmore steadfast might nor any prowess, as when for nine\\nwhole years continually thou didst battle with the Trojans\\nfor high born Helen, of the white arms, and many men thou\\nslewest in terrible warfare, and by thy device the\\nwide-wayed city of Priam was taken. How then, now that thou\\nart come to thy house and thine own possessions, dost thou\\nbewail thee and art of feeble courage to stand before the\\nwooers? Nay, come hither, friend, and stand by me, and I\\nwill show thee a thing, that thou mayest know what manner\\nof man is Mentor, son of Alcimus, to repay good deeds in\\nthe ranks of foemen.\\'\\n\\nShe spake, and gave him not yet clear victory in full, but\\nstill for a while made trial of the might and prowess of\\nOdysseus and his renowned son. As for her she flew up to\\nthe roof timber of the murky hall, in such fashion as a\\nswallow flies, and there sat down.\\n\\nNow Agelaus, son of Damastor, urged on the wooers, and\\nlikewise Eurynomus and Amphimedon and Demoptolemus and\\nPeisandrus son of Polyctor, and wise Polybus, for these\\nwere in valiancy far the best men of the wooers, that still\\nlived and fought for their lives; for the rest had fallen\\nalready beneath the bow and the thick rain of arrows. Then\\nAgelaus spake among them, and made known his word to all:\\n\\n\\'Friends, now at last will this man hold his unconquerable\\nhands. Lo, now has Mentor left him and spoken but vain\\nboasts, and these remain alone at the entrance of the\\ndoors. Wherefore now, throw not your long spears all\\ntogether, but come, do ye six cast first, if perchance Zeus\\nmay grant us to smite Odysseus and win renown. Of the rest\\nwill we take no heed, so soon as that man shall have\\nfallen.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake and they all cast their javelins, as he bade\\nthem, eagerly; but behold, Athene so wrought that they were\\nall in vain. One man smote the doorpost of the stablished\\nhall, and another the well-fastened door, and the ashen\\nspear of yet another wooer, heavy with bronze, stuck fast\\nin the wall. So when they had avoided all the spears of the\\nwooers, the steadfast goodly Odysseus began first to speak\\namong them:\\n\\n\\'Friends, now my word is that we too cast and hurl into the\\npress of the wooers, that are mad to slay and strip us\\nbeyond the measure of their former iniquities.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and they all took good aim and threw their\\nsharp spears, and Odysseus smote Demoptolemus, and\\nTelemachus Euryades, and the swineherd slew Elatus, and the\\nneatherd Peisandrus. Thus they all bit the wide floor with\\ntheir teeth, and the wooers fell back into the inmost part\\nof the hall. But the others dashed upon them and drew forth\\nthe shafts from the bodies of the dead.\\n\\nThen once more the wooers threw their sharp spears eagerly;\\nbut behold, Athene so wrought that many of them were in\\nvain. One man smote the door-post of the stablished hall,\\nand another the well-fastened door, and the ashen spear of\\nanother wooer, heavy with bronze, struck in the wall. Yet\\nAmphimedon hit Telemachus on the hand by the wrist lightly,\\nand the shaft of bronze wounded the surface of the skin.\\nAnd Ctesippus grazed the shoulder of Eumaeus with a long\\nspear high above the shield, and the spear flew over and\\nfell to the ground. Then again Odysseus, the wise and\\ncrafty, he and his men cast their swift spears into the\\npress of the wooers, and now once more Odysseus, waster of\\ncities, smote Eurydamas, and Telemachus Amphimedon, and the\\nswineherd slew Polybus, and last, the neatherd struck\\nCtesippus in the breast and boasted over him, saying:\\n\\n\\'O son of Polytherses, thou lover of jeering, never give\\nplace at all to folly to speak so big, but leave thy case\\nto the gods, since in truth they are far mightier than\\nthou. This gift is thy recompense for the ox-foot that thou\\ngavest of late to the divine Odysseus, when he went begging\\nthrough the house.\\'\\n\\nSo spake the keeper of the shambling kine. Next Odysseus\\nwounded the son of Damastor in close fight with his long\\nspear, and Telemachus wounded Leocritus son of Euenor,\\nright in the flank with his lance, and drave the bronze\\npoint clean through, that he fell prone and struck the\\nground full with his forehead. Then Athene held up her\\ndestroying aegis on high from the roof, and their minds\\nwere scared, and they fled through the hall, like a drove\\nof kine that the flitting gadfly falls upon and scatters\\nhither and thither in spring time, when the long days\\nbegin. But the others set on like vultures of crooked claws\\nand curved beak, that come forth from the mountains and\\ndash upon smaller birds, and these scour low in the plain,\\nstooping in terror from the clouds, while the vultures\\npounce on them and slay them, and there is no help nor way\\nof flight, and men are glad at the sport; even so did the\\ncompany of Odysseus set upon the wooers and smite them\\nright and left through the hall; and there rose a hideous\\nmoaning as their heads were smitten, and the floor all ran\\nwith blood.\\n\\nNow Leiodes took hold of the knees of Odysseus eagerly, and\\nbesought him and spake winged words: \\'I entreat thee by thy\\nknees, Odysseus, and do thou show mercy on me and have\\npity. For never yet, I say, have I wronged a maiden in thy\\nhalls by froward word or deed, nay I bade the other wooers\\nrefrain, whoso of them wrought thus. But they hearkened not\\nunto me to keep their hands from evil. Wherefore they have\\nmet a shameful death through their own infatuate deeds.\\nYet I, the soothsayer among them, that have wrought no\\nevil, shall fall even as they, for no grace abides for good\\ndeeds done.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels looked askance at him, and\\nsaid: \\'If indeed thou dost avow thee to be the soothsayer\\nof these men, thou art like to have often prayed in the\\nhalls that the issue of a glad return might be far from me,\\nand that my dear wife should follow thee and bear thee\\nchildren; wherefore thou shalt not escape the bitterness of\\ndeath.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he caught up a sword in his strong hand, that lay\\nwhere Agelaus had let it fall to the ground when he was\\nslain, and drave it clean through his neck, and as he yet\\nspake his head fell even to the dust.\\n\\nBut the son of Terpes, the minstrel, still sought how he\\nmight shun black fate, Phemius, who sang among the wooers\\nof necessity. He stood with the loud lyre in his hand hard\\nby the postern gate, and his heart was divided within him,\\nwhether he should slip forth from the hall and sit down by\\nthe well-wrought altar of great Zeus of the household\\ncourt, whereon Laertes and Odysseus had burnt many pieces\\nof the thighs of oxen, or should spring forward and beseech\\nOdysseus by his knees. And as he thought thereupon this\\nseemed to him the better way, to embrace the knees of\\nOdysseus, son of Laertes. So he laid the hollow lyre on the\\nground between the mixing-bowl and the high seat inlaid\\nwith silver, and himself sprang forward and seized Odysseus\\nby the knees, and besought him and spake winged words:\\n\\n\\'I entreat thee by thy knees, Odysseus, and do thou show\\nmercy on me and have pity. It will be a sorrow to thyself\\nin the aftertime if thou slayest me who am a minstrel, and\\nsing before gods and men. Yea none has taught me but\\nmyself, and the god has put into my heart all manner of\\nlays, and methinks I sing to thee as to a god, wherefore be\\nnot eager to cut off my head. And Telemachus will testify\\nof this, thine own dear son, that not by mine own will or\\ndesire did I resort to thy house to sing to the wooers at\\ntheir feasts; but being so many and stronger than I they\\nled me by constraint.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and the mighty prince Telemachus heard him and\\nquickly spake to his father at his side: \\'Hold thy hand,\\nand wound not this blameless man with the sword; and let us\\nsave also the henchman Medon, that ever had charge of me in\\nour house when I was a child, unless perchance Philoetius\\nor the swineherd have already slain him, or he hath met\\nthee in thy raging through the house.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and Medon, wise of heart, heard him. For he\\nlay crouching beneath a high seat, clad about in the\\nnew-flayed hide of an ox and shunned black fate. So he rose\\nup quickly from under the seat, and cast off the ox-hide,\\nand sprang forth and caught Telemachus by the knees, and\\nbesought him and spake winged words:\\n\\n\\'Friend, here am I; prithee stay thy hand and speak to thy\\nfather, lest he harm me with the sharp sword in the\\ngreatness of his strength, out of his anger for the wooers\\nthat wasted his possessions in the halls, and in their\\nfolly held thee in no honour.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels smiled on him and said: \\'Take\\ncourage, for lo, he has saved thee and delivered thee, that\\nthou mayst know in thy heart, and tell it even to another,\\nhow far more excellent are good deeds than evil. But go\\nforth from the halls and sit down in the court apart from\\nthe slaughter, thou and the full-voiced minstrel, till I\\nhave accomplished all that I must needs do in the house.\\'\\n\\nTherewith the two went forth and gat them from the hall. So\\nthey sat down by the altar of great Zeus, peering about on\\nevery side, still expecting death. And Odysseus peered all\\nthrough the house, to see if any man was yet alive and\\nhiding away to shun black fate. But he found all the sort\\nof them fallen in their blood in the dust, like fishes that\\nthe fishermen have drawn forth in the meshes of the net\\ninto a hollow of the beach from out the grey sea, and all\\nthe fish, sore longing for the salt sea waves, are heaped\\nupon the sand, and the sun shines forth and takes their\\nlife away; so now the wooers lay heaped upon each other.\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels spake to Telemachus:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, go, call me the nurse Eurycleia, that I may\\ntell her a word that is on my mind.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and Telemachus obeyed his dear father, and\\nsmote at the door, and spake to the nurse Eurycleia: \\'Up\\nnow, aged wife, that overlookest all the women servants in\\nour halls, come hither, my father calls thee and has\\nsomewhat to say to thee.\\'\\n\\nEven so he spake, and wingless her speech remained, and she\\nopened the doors of the fair-lying halls, and came forth,\\nand Telemachus led the way before her. So she found\\nOdysseus among the bodies of the dead, stained with blood\\nand soil of battle, like a lion that has eaten of an ox of\\nthe homestead and goes on his way, and all his breast and\\nhis cheeks on either side are flecked with blood, and he is\\nterrible to behold; even so was Odysseus stained, both\\nhands and feet. Now the nurse, when she saw the bodies of\\nthe dead and the great gore of blood, made ready to cry\\naloud for joy, beholding so great an adventure. But\\nOdysseus checked and held her in her eagerness, and\\nuttering his voice spake to her winged words:\\n\\n\\'Within thine own heart rejoice, old nurse, and be still,\\nand cry not aloud; for it is an unholy thing to boast over\\nslain men. Now these hath the destiny of the gods overcome,\\nand their own cruel deeds, for they honoured none of\\nearthly men, neither the bad nor yet the good, that came\\namong them. Wherefore they have met a shameful death\\nthrough their own infatuate deeds. But come, tell me the\\ntale of the women in my halls, which of them dishonour me,\\nand which be guiltless.\\'\\n\\nThen the good nurse Eurycleia answered him: \\'Yea now, my\\nchild, I will tell thee all the truth. Thou hast fifty\\nwomen-servants in thy halls, that we have taught the ways\\nof housewifery, how to card wool and to bear bondage. Of\\nthese twelve in all have gone the way of shame, and honour\\nnot me, nor their lady Penelope. And Telemachus hath but\\nnewly come to his strength, and his mother suffered him not\\nto take command over the women in this house. But now, let\\nme go aloft to the shining upper chamber, and tell all to\\nthy wife, on whom some god hath sent a sleep.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: \\'Wake\\nher not yet, but bid the women come hither, who in time\\npast behaved themselves unseemly.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and the old wife passed through the hall, to\\ntell the women and to hasten their coming. Then Odysseus\\ncalled to him Telemachus, and the neatherd, and the\\nswineherd, and spake to them winged words:\\n\\n\\'Begin ye now to carry out the dead, and bid the women help\\nyou, and thereafter cleanse the fair high seats and the\\ntables with water and porous sponges. And when ye have set\\nall the house in order, lead the maidens without the\\nstablished hall, between the vaulted room and the goodly\\nfence of the court, and there slay them with your long\\nblades, till they shall have all given up the ghost and\\nforgotten the love that of old they had at the bidding of\\nthe wooers, in secret dalliance.\\'\\n\\nEven so he spake, and the women came all in a crowd\\ntogether, making a terrible lament and shedding big tears.\\nSo first they carried forth the bodies of the slain, and\\nset them beneath the gallery of the fenced court, and\\npropped them one on another; and Odysseus himself hasted\\nthe women and directed them, and they carried forth the\\ndead perforce. Thereafter they cleansed the fair high seats\\nand the tables with water and porous sponges. And\\nTelemachus, and the neatherd, and the swineherd, scraped\\nwith spades the floor of the well-builded house, and,\\nbehold, the maidens carried all forth and laid it without\\nthe doors.\\n\\nNow when they had made an end of setting the hall in order,\\nthey led the maidens forth from the stablished hall, and\\ndrove them up in a narrow space between the vaulted room\\nand the goodly fence of the court, whence none might avoid;\\nand wise Telemachus began to speak to his fellows, saying:\\n\\'God forbid that I should take these women\\'s lives by a\\nclean death, these that have poured dishonour on my head\\nand on my mother, and have lain with the wooers.\\'\\n\\nWith that word he tied the cable of a dark-prowed ship to a\\ngreat pillar and flung it round the vaulted room, and\\nfastened it aloft, that none might touch the ground with\\nher feet. And even as when thrushes, long of wing, or doves\\nfall into a net that is set in a thicket, as they seek to\\ntheir roosting-place, and a loathly bed harbours them, even\\nso the women held their heads all in a row, and about all\\ntheir necks nooses were cast, that they might die by the\\nmost pitiful death. And they writhed with their feet for a\\nlittle space, but for no long while.\\n\\nThen they led out Melanthius through the doorway and the\\ncourt, and cut off his nostrils and his ears with the\\npitiless sword, and drew forth his vitals for the dogs to\\ndevour raw, and cut off his hands and feet in their cruel\\nanger.\\n\\nThereafter they washed their hands and feet, and went into\\nthe house to Odysseus, and all the adventure was over. So\\nOdysseus called to the good nurse Eurycleia: \\'Bring\\nsulphur, old nurse, that cleanses all pollution and bring\\nme fire, that I may purify the house with sulphur, and do\\nthou bid Penelope come here with her handmaidens, and tell\\nall the women to hasten into the hall.\\'\\n\\nThen the good nurse Eurycleia made answer: \\'Yea, my child,\\nherein thou hast spoken aright. But go to, let me bring\\nthee a mantle and a doublet for raiment, and stand not thus\\nin the halls with thy broad shoulders wrapped in rags; it\\nwere blame in thee so to do.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: \\'First\\nlet a fire now be made me in the hall.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and the good nurse Eurycleia was not slow to\\nobey, but brought fire and brimstone; and Odysseus\\nthoroughly purged the women\\'s chamber and the great hall\\nand the court.\\n\\nThen the old wife went through the fair halls of Odysseus\\nto tell the women, and to hasten their coming. So they came\\nforth from their chamber with torches in their hands, and\\nfell about Odysseus, and embraced him and kissed and\\nclasped his head and shoulders and his hands lovingly, and\\na sweet longing came on him to weep and moan, for he\\nremembered them every one.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XXIII\\n\\n  Odysseus maketh himself known to Penelope, tells his\\n  adventures briefly, and in the morning goes to Laertes\\n  and makes himself known to him.\\n\\nThen the ancient woman went up into the upper chamber\\nlaughing aloud, to tell her mistress how her dear lord was\\nwithin, and her knees moved fast for joy, and her feet\\nstumbled one over the other; and she stood above the lady\\'s\\nhead and spake to her, saying:\\n\\n\\'Awake, Penelope, dear child, that thou mayest see with\\nthine own eyes that which thou desirest day by day.\\nOdysseus hath come, and hath got him to his own house,\\nthough late hath he come, and hath slain the proud wooers\\nthat troubled his house, and devoured his substance, and\\noppressed his child.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered her: \\'Dear nurse, the gods have\\nmade thee distraught, the gods that can make foolish even\\nthe wisdom of the wise, and that stablish the simple in\\nunderstanding. They it is that have marred thy reason,\\nthough heretofore thou hadst a prudent heart. Why dost thou\\nmock me, who have a spirit full of sorrow, to speak these\\nwild words, and rousest me out of sweet slumber, that had\\nbound me and overshadowed mine eyelids? Never yet have I\\nslept so sound since the day that Odysseus went forth to\\nsee that evil Ilios, never to be named. Go to now, get thee\\ndown and back to the women\\'s chamber, for if any other of\\nthe maids of my house had come and brought me such tidings,\\nand wakened me from sleep, straightway would I have sent\\nher back woefully to return within the women\\'s chamber; but\\nthis time thine old age shall stand thee in good stead.\\'\\n\\nThen the good nurse Eurycleia answered her: \\'I mock thee\\nnot, dear child, but in very deed Odysseus is here, and\\nhath come home, even as I tell thee. He is that guest on\\nwhom all men wrought such dishonour in the halls. But long\\nago Telemachus was ware of him, that he was within the\\nhouse, yet in his prudence he hid the counsels of his\\nfather, that he might take vengeance on the violence of the\\nhaughty wooers.\\'\\n\\nThus she spake, and then was Penelope glad, and leaping\\nfrom her bed she fell on the old woman\\'s neck, and let fall\\nthe tears from her eyelids, and uttering her voice spake to\\nher winged words: \\'Come, dear nurse, I pray thee, tell me\\nall truly--if indeed he hath come home as thou sayest--how\\nhe hath laid his hands on the shameless wooers, he being\\nbut one man, while they abode ever in their companies\\nwithin the house.\\'\\n\\nThen the good nurse Eurycleia answered her: \\'I saw not, I\\nwist not, only I heard the groaning of men slain. And we in\\nan inmost place of the well-builded chambers sat all\\namazed, and the close-fitted doors shut in the room, till\\nthy son called me from the chamber, for his father sent him\\nout to that end. Then I found Odysseus standing among the\\nslain, who around him, stretched on the hard floor, lay one\\nupon the other; it would have comforted thy heart to see\\nhim, all stained like a lion with blood and soil of battle.\\nAnd now are all the wooers gathered in an heap by the gates\\nof the court, while he is purifying his fair house with\\nbrimstone, and hath kindled a great fire, and hath sent me\\nforth to call thee. So come with me, that ye may both enter\\ninto your heart\\'s delight, {*} for ye have suffered much\\naffliction. And even now hath this thy long desire been\\nfulfilled; thy lord hath come alive to his own hearth, and\\nhath found both thee and his son in the halls; and the\\nwooers that wrought him evil he hath slain, every man of\\nthem in his house.\\'\\n\\n{* Reading [Greek] . . . [Greek].}\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered her: \\'Dear nurse, boast not yet\\nover them with laughter. Thou knowest how welcome the sight\\nof him would be in the halls to all, and to me in chief,\\nand to his son that we got between us. But this is no true\\ntale, as thou declarest it, nay but it is one of the\\ndeathless gods that hath slain the proud wooers, in wrath\\nat their bitter insolence and evil deeds. For they honoured\\nnone of earthly men, neither the good nor yet the bad, that\\ncame among them. Wherefore they have suffered an evil doom\\nthrough their own infatuate deeds. But Odysseus, far away\\nhath lost his homeward path to the Achaean land, and\\nhimself is lost.\\'\\n\\nThen the good nurse Eurycleia made answer to her: \\'My\\nchild, what word hath escaped the door of thy lips, in that\\nthou saidest that thy lord, who is even now within, and by\\nhis own hearthstone, would return no more? Nay, thy heart\\nis ever hard of belief. Go to now, and I will tell thee\\nbesides a most manifest token, even the scar of the wound\\nthat the boar on a time dealt him with his white tusk.\\nThis I spied while washing his feet, and fain I would have\\ntold it even to thee, but he laid his hand on my mouth, and\\nin the fulness of his wisdom suffered me not to speak. But\\ncome with me and I will stake my life on it; and if I play\\nthee false, do thou slay me by a death most pitiful.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope made answer to her: \\'Dear nurse, it is\\nhard for thee, how wise soever, to observe the purposes of\\nthe everlasting gods. None the less let us go to my child,\\nthat I may see the wooers dead, and him that slew them.\\'\\n\\nWith that word she went down from the upper chamber, and\\nmuch her heart debated, whether she should stand apart, and\\nquestion her dear lord or draw nigh, and clasp and kiss his\\nhead and hands. But when she had come within and had\\ncrossed the threshold of stone, she sat down over against\\nOdysseus, in the light of the fire, by the further wall.\\nNow he was sitting by the tall pillar, looking down and\\nwaiting to know if perchance his noble wife would speak to\\nhim, when her eyes beheld him. But she sat long in silence,\\nand amazement came upon her soul, and now she would look\\nupon him steadfastly with her eyes, and now again she knew\\nhim not, for that he was clad in vile raiment. And\\nTelemachus rebuked her, and spake and hailed her:\\n\\n\\'Mother mine, ill mother, of an ungentle heart, why turnest\\nthou thus away from my father, and dost not sit by him and\\nquestion him and ask him all? No other woman in the world\\nwould harden her heart to stand thus aloof from her lord,\\nwho after much travail and sore had come to her in the\\ntwentieth year to his own country. But thy heart is ever\\nharder than stone.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him, saying: \\'Child, my mind is\\namazed within me, and I have no strength to speak, nor to\\nask him aught, nay nor to look on him face to face. But if\\nin truth this be Odysseus, and he hath indeed come home,\\nverily we shall be ware of each other the more surely, for\\nwe have tokens that we twain know, even we, secret from all\\nothers.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus smiled, and\\nquickly he spake to Telemachus winged words: \\'Telemachus,\\nleave now thy mother to make trial of me within the\\nchambers; so shall she soon come to a better knowledge than\\nheretofore. But now I go filthy, and am clad in vile\\nraiment, wherefore she has me in dishonour, and as yet will\\nnot allow that I am he. Let us then advise us how all may\\nbe for the very best. For whoso has slain but one man in a\\nland, even that one leaves not many behind him to take up\\nthe feud for him, turns outlaw and leaves his kindred and\\nhis own country; but we have slain the very stay of the\\ncity, the men who were far the best of all the noble youths\\nin Ithaca. So this I bid thee consider.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Father, see\\nthou to this, for they say that thy counsel is far the best\\namong men, nor might any other of mortal men contend with\\nthee. But right eagerly will we go with thee now, and I\\nthink we shall not lack prowess, so far as might is ours.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: \\'Yea\\nnow, I will tell on what wise methinks it is best. First,\\ngo ye to the bath and array you in your doublets, and bid\\nthe maidens in the chambers to take to them their garments.\\nThen let the divine minstrel, with his loud lyre in hand,\\nlead off for us the measure of the mirthful dance. So shall\\nany man that hears the sound from without, whether a\\nwayfarer or one of those that dwell around, say that it is\\na wedding feast. And thus the slaughter of the wooers shall\\nnot be noised abroad through the town before we go forth to\\nour well-wooded farm-land. Thereafter shall we consider\\nwhat gainful counsel the Olympian may vouchsafe us.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and they gave good ear and hearkened to him.\\nSo first they went to the bath, and arrayed them in\\ndoublets, and the women were apparelled, and the divine\\nminstrel took the hollow harp, and aroused in them the\\ndesire of sweet song and of the happy dance. Then the great\\nhall rang round them with the sound of the feet of dancing\\nmen and of fair-girdled women. And whoso heard it from\\nwithout would say:\\n\\n\\'Surely some one has wedded the queen of many wooers. Hard\\nof heart was she, nor had she courage to keep the great\\nhouse of her wedded lord continually till his coming.\\'\\n\\nEven so men spake, and knew not how these things were\\nordained. Meanwhile, the house-dame Eurynome had bathed the\\ngreat-hearted Odysseus within his house, and anointed him\\nwith olive-oil, and cast about him a goodly mantle and a\\ndoublet. Moreover Athene shed great beauty from his head\\ndownwards, and made him greater and more mighty to behold,\\nand from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like\\nthe hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays\\ngold upon silver, one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene\\nhave taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his\\nhandiwork, even so did Athene shed grace about his head and\\nshoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in form like to\\nthe immortals. Then he sat down again on the high seat,\\nwhence he had arisen, over against his wife, and spake to\\nher, saying:\\n\\n\\'Strange lady, surely to thee above all womankind the\\nOlympians have given a heart that cannot be softened. No\\nother woman in the world would harden her heart to stand\\nthus aloof from her husband, who after much travail and\\nsore had come to her, in the twentieth year, to his own\\ncountry. Nay come, nurse, strew a bed for me to lie all\\nalone, for assuredly her spirit within her is as iron.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him again: \\'Strange man, I have\\nno proud thoughts nor do I think scorn of thee, nor am I\\ntoo greatly astonied, but I know right well what manner of\\nman thou wert, when thou wentest forth out of Ithaca, on\\nthe long-oared galley. But come, Eurycleia, spread for him\\nthe good bedstead outside the stablished bridal chamber\\nthat he built himself. Thither bring ye forth the good\\nbedstead and cast bedding thereon, even fleeces and rugs\\nand shining blankets.\\'\\n\\nSo she spake and made trial of her lord, but Odysseus in\\nsore displeasure spake to his true wife, saying: \\'Verily a\\nbitter word is this, lady, that thou hast spoken. Who has\\nset my bed otherwhere? Hard it would be for one, how\\nskilled so ever, unless a god were to come that might\\neasily set it in another place, if so he would. But of men\\nthere is none living, howsoever strong in his youth, that\\ncould lightly upheave it, for a great token is wrought in\\nthe fashioning of the bed, and it was I that made it and\\nnone other. There was growing a bush of olive, long of\\nleaf, and most goodly of growth, within the inner court,\\nand the stem as large as a pillar. Round about this I built\\nthe chamber, till I had finished it, with stones close set,\\nand I roofed it over well and added thereto compacted doors\\nfitting well. Next I sheared off all the light wood of the\\nlong-leaved olive, and rough-hewed the trunk upwards from\\nthe root, and smoothed it around with the adze, well and\\nskilfully, and made straight the line thereto and so\\nfashioned it into the bedpost, and I bored it all with the\\nauger. Beginning from this bedpost, I wrought at the\\nbedstead till I had finished it, and made it fair with\\ninlaid work of gold and of silver and of ivory. Then I made\\nfast therein a bright purple band of oxhide. Even so I\\ndeclare to thee this token, and I know not, lady, if the\\nbedstead be yet fast in his place, or if some man has cut\\naway the stem of the olive tree, and set the bedstead\\notherwhere.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and at once her knees were loosened, and her\\nheart melted within her, as she knew the sure tokens that\\nOdysseus showed her. Then she fell a weeping, and ran\\nstraight toward him and cast her hands about his neck, and\\nkissed his head and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Be not angry with me, Odysseus, for thou wert ever at\\nother times the wisest of men. It is the gods that gave us\\nsorrow, the gods who begrudged us that we should abide\\ntogether and have joy of our youth, and come to the\\nthreshold of old age. So now be not wroth with me hereat\\nnor full of indignation, because at the first, when I saw\\nthee, I did not welcome thee straightway. For always my\\nheart within my breast shuddered, for fear lest some man\\nshould come and deceive me with his words, for many they be\\nthat devise gainful schemes and evil. Nay even Argive\\nHelen, daughter of Zeus, would not have lain with a\\nstranger, and taken him for a lover, had she known that the\\nwarlike sons of the Achaeans would bring her home again to\\nher own dear country. Howsoever, it was the god that set\\nher upon this shameful deed; nor ever, ere that, did she\\nlay up in her heart the thought of this folly, a bitter\\nfolly, whence on us too first came sorrow. But now that\\nthou hast told all the sure tokens of our bed, which never\\nwas seen by mortal man, save by thee and me and one maiden\\nonly, the daughter of Actor, that my father gave me ere yet\\nI had come hither, she who kept the doors of our strong\\nbridal chamber, even now dost thou bend my soul, all\\nungentle as it is.\\'\\n\\nThus she spake, and in his heart she stirred yet a greater\\nlonging to lament, and he wept as he embraced his beloved\\nwife and true. And even as when the sight of land is\\nwelcome to swimmers, whose well-wrought ship Poseidon hath\\nsmitten on the deep, all driven with the wind and swelling\\nwaves, and but a remnant hath escaped the grey sea-water\\nand swum to the shore, and their bodies are all crusted\\nwith the brine, and gladly have they set foot on land and\\nescaped an evil end; so welcome to her was the sight of her\\nlord, and her white arms she would never quite let go from\\nhis neck. And now would the rosy-fingered Dawn have risen\\nupon their weeping, but the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had\\nother thoughts. The night she held long in the utmost West,\\nand on the other side she stayed the golden-throned Dawn by\\nthe stream Oceanus, and suffered her not to harness the\\nswift-footed steeds that bear light to men, Lampus and\\nPhaethon, the steeds ever young, that bring the morning.\\n\\nThen at the last, Odysseus of many counsels spake to his\\nwife, saying: \\'Lady, we have not yet come to the issue of\\nall our labours; but still there will be toil unmeasured,\\nlong and difficult, that I must needs bring to a full end.\\nEven so the spirit of Teiresias foretold to me, on that day\\nwhen I went down into the house of Hades, to inquire after\\na returning for myself and my company. Wherefore come,\\nlady, let us to bed, that forthwith we may take our joy of\\nrest beneath the spell of sweet sleep.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him: \\'Thy bed verily shall be\\nready whensoever thy soul desires it, forasmuch as the gods\\nhave indeed caused thee to come back to thy stablished home\\nand thine own country. But now that thou hast noted it and\\nthe god has put it into thy heart, come, tell me of this\\nordeal, for methinks the day will come when I must learn\\nit, and timely knowledge is no hurt.\\'\\n\\nAnd Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: \\'Ah, why\\nnow art thou so instant with me to declare it? Yet I will\\ntell thee all and hide nought. Howbeit thy heart shall have\\nno joy of it, as even I myself have no pleasure therein.\\nFor Teiresias bade me fare to many cities of men, carrying\\na shapen oar in my hands, till I should come to such men as\\nknow not the sea, neither eat meat savoured with salt, nor\\nhave they knowledge of ships of purple cheek nor of shapen\\noars, which serve for wings to ships. And he told me this\\nwith manifest token, which I will not hide from thee. In\\nthe day when another wayfarer should meet me and say that I\\nhad a winnowing fan on my stout shoulder, even then he bade\\nme make fast my shapen oar in the earth, and do goodly\\nsacrifice to the lord Poseidon, even with a ram and a bull\\nand a boar, the mate of swine, and depart for home, and\\noffer holy hecatombs to the deathless gods, that keep the\\nwide heaven, to each in order due. And from the sea shall\\nmine own death come, the gentlest death that may be, which\\nshall end me, foredone, with smooth old age, and the folk\\nshall dwell happily around. All this, he said, was to be\\nfulfilled.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Penelope answered him saying: \\'If indeed the gods\\nwill bring about for thee a happier old age at the last,\\nthen is there hope that thou mayest yet have an escape from\\nevil.\\'\\n\\nThus they spake one to the other. Meanwhile, Eurynome and\\nthe nurse spread the bed with soft coverlets, by the light\\nof the torches burning. But when they had busied them and\\nspread the good bed, the ancient nurse went back to her\\nchamber to lie down, and Eurynome, the bower-maiden, guided\\nthem on their way to the couch, with torches in her hands,\\nand when she had led them to the bridal-chamber she\\ndeparted. And so they came gladly to the rites of their\\nbed, as of old. But Telemachus, and the neatherd, and the\\nswineherd stayed their feet from dancing, and made the\\nwomen to cease, and themselves gat them to rest through the\\nshadowy halls.\\n\\nNow when the twain had taken their fill of sweet love, they\\nhad delight in the tales, which they told one to the other.\\nThe fair lady spoke of all that she had endured in the\\nhalls at the sight of the ruinous throng of wooers, who for\\nher sake slew many cattle, kine and goodly sheep; and many\\na cask of wine was broached. And in turn, Odysseus, of the\\nseed of Zeus, recounted all the griefs he had wrought on\\nmen, and all his own travail and sorrow, and she was\\ndelighted with the story, and sweet sleep fell not upon her\\neyelids till the tale was ended.\\n\\nHe began by setting forth how he overcame the Cicones, and\\nnext arrived at the rich land of the Lotus-eaters, and all\\nthat the Cyclops wrought, and what a price he got from him\\nfor the good companions that he devoured, and showed no\\npity. Then how he came to Aeolus, who received him gladly\\nand sent him on his way; but it was not yet ordained that\\nhe should reach his own country, for the storm-wind seized\\nhim again, and bare him over the teeming seas, making\\ngrievous moan. Next how he came to Telepylus of the\\nLaestrygonians, who brake his ships and slew all his\\ngoodly-greaved companions, and Odysseus only escaped with\\nhis black ship. Then he told all the wiles and many\\ncontrivances of Circe, and how in a benched ship he fared\\nto the dank house of Hades, to seek to the soul of Theban\\nTeiresias. There he beheld all those that had been his\\ncompanions, and his mother who bore him and nurtured him,\\nwhile yet he was a little one. Then how he heard the song\\nof the full-voiced Sirens, and came to the Rocks Wandering,\\nand to terrible Charybdis, and to Scylla, that never yet\\nhave men avoided scatheless. Next he told how his company\\nslew the kine of Helios, and how Zeus, that thunders on\\nhigh, smote the swift ship with the flaming bolt, and the\\ngood crew perished all together, and he alone escaped from\\nevil fates. And how he came to the isle Ogygia, and to the\\nnymph Calypso, who kept him there in her hollow caves,\\nlonging to have him for her lord, and nurtured him and said\\nthat she would make him never to know death or age all his\\ndays: yet she never won his heart within his breast. Next\\nhow with great toil he came to the Phaeacians, who gave him\\nall worship heartily, as to a god, and sent him with a ship\\nto his own dear country, with gifts of bronze, and of gold,\\nand raiment in plenty. This was the last word of the tale,\\nwhen sweet sleep came speedily upon him, sleep that loosens\\nthe limbs of men, unknitting the cares of his soul.\\n\\nThen the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to new thoughts.\\nWhen she deemed that Odysseus had taken his fill of love\\nand sleep, straightway she aroused from out Oceanus the\\ngolden-throned Dawn, to bear light to men. Then Odysseus\\ngat him from his soft bed, and laid this charge on his\\nwife, saying:\\n\\n\\'Lady, already have we had enough of labours, thou and I;\\nthou, in weeping here, and longing for my troublous return,\\nI, while Zeus and the other gods bound me fast in pain,\\ndespite my yearning after home, away from mine own country.\\nBut now that we both have come to the bed of our desire,\\ntake thou thought for the care of my wealth within the\\nhalls. But as for the sheep that the proud wooers have\\nslain, I myself will lift many more as spoil, and others\\nthe Achaeans will give, till they fill all my folds. But\\nnow, behold, I go to the well-wooded farm-land, to see my\\ngood father, who for love of me has been in sorrow\\ncontinually. And this charge I lay on thee, lady, too wise\\nthough thou art to need it. Quickly will the bruit go forth\\nwith the rising sun, the bruit concerning the wooers, whom\\nI slew in the halls. Wherefore ascend with the women thy\\nhandmaids into the upper chamber, and sit there and look on\\nno man, nor ask any question.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he girded on his shoulder his goodly armour, and\\nroused Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd, and\\nbade them all take weapons of war in their hands. So they\\nwere not disobedient to his word, but clad themselves in\\nmail, and opened the doors and went forth, and Odysseus led\\nthe way. And now there was light over all the earth; but\\nthem Athene hid in night, and quickly conducted out of the\\ntown.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook XXIV\\n\\n  The Ithacans bury the wooers, and sitting in council\\n  resolve on revenge. And coming near the house of Laertes,\\n  are met by Odysseus, and Laertes with Telemachus and\\n  servants, the whole number twelve, and are overcome,\\n  and submit.\\n\\nNow Cyllenian Hermes called forth from the halls the souls\\nof the wooers, and he held in his hand his wand that is\\nfair and golden, wherewith he lulls the eyes of men, of\\nwhomso he will, while others again he even wakens out of\\nsleep. Herewith he roused and led the souls who followed\\ngibbering. And even as bats flit gibbering in the secret\\nplace of a wondrous cave, when one has fallen down from the\\ncluster on the rock, where they cling each to each up\\naloft, even so the souls gibbered as they fared together,\\nand Hermes, the helper, led them down the dank ways. Past\\nthe streams of Oceanus and the White Rock, past the gates\\nof the Sun they sped and the land of dreams, and soon they\\ncame to the mead of asphodel, where dwell the souls, the\\nphantoms of men outworn. There they found the soul of\\nAchilles son of Peleus, and the souls of Patroclus, and of\\nnoble Antilochus, and of Aias, who in face and form was\\ngoodliest of all the Danaans after the noble son of Peleus.\\n\\nSo these were flocking round Achilles, and the spirit of\\nAgamemnon, son of Atreus, drew nigh sorrowful; and about\\nhim were gathered all the other shades, as many as perished\\nwith him in the house of Aegisthus, and met their doom.\\nNow the soul of the son of Peleus spake to him first,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Son of Atreus, verily we deemed that thou above all other\\nheroes wast evermore dear to Zeus, whose joy is in the\\nthunder, seeing that thou wast lord over warriors, many and\\nmighty men, in the land of the Trojans where we Achaeans\\nsuffered affliction. But lo, thee too was deadly doom to\\nvisit early, {*} the doom that none avoids of all men born.\\nAh, would that in the fulness of thy princely honour, thou\\nhadst met death and fate in the land of the Trojans! So\\nwould all the Achaean host have builded thee a barrow, yea\\nand for thy son thou wouldst have won great glory in the\\naftertime. But now it has been decreed for thee to perish\\nby a most pitiful death.\\'\\n\\n{* Reading [Greek]}\\n\\nThen the soul of the son of Atreus answered, and spake:\\n\\'Happy art thou son of Peleus, godlike Achilles, that didst\\ndie in Troy-land far from Argos, and about thee fell\\nothers, the best of the sons of Trojans and Achaeans,\\nfighting for thy body; but thou in the whirl of dust layest\\nmighty and mightily fallen, forgetful of thy chivalry. And\\nwe strove the livelong day, nor would we ever have ceased\\nfrom the fight, if Zeus had not stayed us with a tempest.\\nAnon when we had borne thee to the ships from out of the\\nbattle, we laid thee on a bier and washed thy fair flesh\\nclean with warm water and unguents, and around thee the\\nDanaans shed many a hot tear and shore their hair. And\\nforth from the sea came thy mother with the deathless\\nmaidens of the waters, when they heard the tidings; and a\\nwonderful wailing rose over the deep, and trembling fell on\\nthe limbs of all the Achaeans. Yea, and they would have\\nsprung up and departed to the hollow ships, had not one\\nheld them back that knew much lore from of old, Nestor,\\nwhose counsel proved heretofore the best. Out of his good\\nwill he made harangue, and spake among them:\\n\\n\\'\"Hold, ye Argives, flee not, young lords of the Achaeans.\\nLo, his mother from the sea is she that comes, with the\\ndeathless maidens of the waters, to behold the face of her\\ndead son.\"\\n\\n\\'So he spake, and the high-hearted Achaeans ceased from\\ntheir flight. Then round thee stood the daughters of the\\nancient one of the sea, holding a pitiful lament, and they\\nclad thee about in raiment incorruptible. And all the nine\\nMuses one to the other replying with sweet voices began the\\ndirge; there thou wouldest not have seen an Argive but\\nwept, so mightily rose up the clear chant. Thus for\\nseventeen days and nights continually did we all bewail\\nthee, immortal gods and mortal men. On the eighteenth day\\nwe gave thy body to the flames, and many well-fatted sheep\\nwe slew around thee, and kine of shambling gait. So thou\\nwert burned in the garments of the gods, and in much\\nunguents and in sweet honey, and many heroes of the\\nAchaeans moved mail-clad around the pyre when thou wast\\nburning, both footmen and horse, and great was the noise\\nthat arose. But when the flame of Hephaestus had utterly\\nabolished thee, lo, in the morning we gathered together thy\\nwhite bones, Achilles, and bestowed them in unmixed wine\\nand in unguents. Thy mother gave a twy-handled golden urn,\\nand said that it was the gift of Dionysus, and the\\nworkmanship of renowned Hephaestus. Therein lie thy white\\nbones, great Achilles, and mingled therewith the bones of\\nPatroclus son of Menoetias, that is dead, but apart is the\\ndust of Antilochus, whom thou didst honour above all thy\\nother companions, after Patroclus that was dead. Then over\\nthem did we pile a great and goodly tomb, we the holy host\\nof Argive warriors, high on a jutting headland over wide\\nHellespont, that it might be far seen from off the sea by\\nmen that now are, and by those that shall be hereafter.\\nThen thy mother asked the gods for glorious prizes in the\\ngames, and set them in the midst of the lists for the\\nchampions of the Achaeans. In days past thou hast been at\\nthe funeral games of many a hero, whenso, after some king\\'s\\ndeath, the young men gird themselves and make them ready\\nfor the meed of victory; but couldst thou have seen these\\ngifts thou wouldst most have marvelled in spirit, such\\nglorious prizes did the goddess set there to honour thee,\\neven Thetis, the silver-footed; for very dear wert thou to\\nthe gods. Thus not even in death hast thou lost thy name,\\nbut to thee shall be a fair renown for ever among all men,\\nAchilles. But what joy have I now herein, that I have wound\\nup the clew of war, for on my return Zeus devised for me an\\nevil end at the hands of Aegisthus and my wife accursed?\\'\\n\\nSo they spake one to the other. And nigh them came the\\nMessenger, the slayer of Argos, leading down the ghosts of\\nthe wooers by Odysseus slain, and the two heroes were\\namazed at the sight and went straight toward them. And the\\nsoul of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, knew the dear son of\\nMelaneus, renowned Amphimedon, who had been his host,\\nhaving his dwelling in Ithaca. The soul of the son of\\nAtreus spake to him first, saying:\\n\\n\\'Amphimedon, what hath befallen you, that ye have come\\nbeneath the darkness of earth, all of you picked men and of\\nlike age? it is even as though one should choose out and\\ngather together the best warriors in a city. Did Poseidon\\nsmite you in your ships and rouse up contrary winds and the\\nlong waves? Or did unfriendly men, perchance, do you hurt\\nupon the land as ye were cutting off their oxen and fair\\nflocks of sheep, or while they fought to defend their city\\nand the women thereof? Answer and tell me, for I avow me a\\nfriend of thy house. Rememberest thou not the day when I\\ncame to your house in Ithaca with godlike Menelaus, to urge\\nOdysseus to follow with me to Ilios on the decked ships?\\nAnd it was a full month ere we had sailed all across the\\nwide sea, for scarce could we win to our cause Odysseus,\\nwaster of cities.\\'\\n\\nThen the ghost of Amphimedon answered him, and spake: \\'Most\\nfamous son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, I remember\\nall these things, O fosterling of Zeus, as thou declarest\\nthem, and I in turn will tell thee all the tale well and\\ntruly, even our death and evil end, on what wise it befell.\\nWe wooed the wife of Odysseus that was long afar, and she\\nneither refused the hated bridal nor was minded to make an\\nend, devising for us death and black fate. Also this other\\nwile she contrived in her heart. She set up in her halls a\\nmighty web, fine of woof and very wide, whereat she would\\nweave, and anon she spake among us:\\n\\n\\'\"Ye princely youths, my wooers, now that goodly Odysseus\\nis dead, do ye abide patiently, how eager soever to speed\\non this marriage of mine, till I finish the robe. I would\\nnot that the threads perish to no avail, even this shroud\\nfor the hero Laertes, against the day when the ruinous doom\\nshall bring him low, of death that lays men at their\\nlength. So shall none of the Achaean women in the land\\ncount it blame in me, as well might be, were he to lie\\nwithout a winding-sheet, a man that had gotten great\\npossessions.\"\\n\\n\\'So spake she, and our high hearts consented thereto. So\\nthen in the daytime she would weave the mighty web, and in\\nthe night unravel the same, when she had let place the\\ntorches by her. Thus for the space of three years she hid\\nthe thing by guile and won the minds of the Achaeans; but\\nwhen the fourth year arrived and the seasons came round, as\\nthe months waned and many days were accomplished, then it\\nwas that one of her women who knew all declared it, and we\\nfound her unravelling the splendid web. Thus she finished\\nit perforce and sore against her will. Now when she brought\\nthe robe to light, after she had woven the great web and\\nwashed it, and it shone even as sun or moon, at that very\\nhour some evil god led Odysseus, I know not whence, to the\\nupland farm, where the swineherd abode in his dwelling.\\nThither too came the dear son of divine Odysseus out of\\nsandy Pylos, voyaging with his black ship. These twain\\nframed an evil death for the wooers, and came to the\\nrenowned town. Odysseus verily came the later, and\\nTelemachus went before and led the way. Now the swineherd\\nbrought Odysseus clad in vile raiment, in the likeness of a\\nbeggar, a wretched man and an old, leaning on a staff, and\\nbehold, he was clad about in sorry raiment. And none of us,\\nnot even the elders, could know him for that he was, on\\nthis his sudden appearing, but with evil words we assailed\\nhim and hurled things at him. Yet for a while he hardened\\nhis heart to endure both the hurlings and the evil words in\\nhis own halls; but at the last, when the spirit of Zeus,\\nlord of the aegis, aroused him, by the help of Telemachus\\nhe took up all the goodly weapons, and laid them by in the\\ninner chamber and drew the bolts. Next in his great craft\\nhe bade his wife to offer his bow and store of grey iron to\\nthe wooers to be the weapons of our contest, luckless that\\nwe were, and the beginning of death. Now not one of us\\ncould stretch the string of the strong bow; far short we\\nfell of that might. But when the great bow came to the\\nhands of Odysseus, then we all clamoured and forbade to\\ngive him the bow, how much soever he might speak, but\\nTelemachus alone was instant with him and commanded him to\\ntake it. Then he took the bow into his hands, the steadfast\\ngoodly Odysseus, and lightly he strung it, and sent the\\narrow through the iron. Then straight he went to the\\nthreshold and there took his stand, and poured forth the\\nswift arrows, glancing terribly around, and smote the king\\nAntinous. Thereafter on the others he let fly his bolts,\\nwinged for death, with straight aim, and the wooers fell\\nthick one upon another. Then was it known how that some god\\nwas their helper, for pressing on as their passion drave\\nthem, they slew the men right and left through the halls,\\nand thence there arose a hideous moaning, as heads were\\nsmitten and the floor all ran with blood. So we perished,\\nAgamemnon, and even now our bodies lie uncared for in the\\nhalls of Odysseus, for the friends of each one at home as\\nyet know nought, even they who might wash the black-clotted\\nblood out of our wounds, and lay out the bodies and wail\\nthe dirge, for that is the due of the dead.\\'\\n\\nThen the ghost of the son of Atreus answered him: \\'Ah,\\nhappy son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, yea, for a\\nwife most excellent hast thou gotten, so good was the\\nwisdom of constant Penelope, daughter of Icarius, that was\\nduly mindful of Odysseus, her wedded lord. Wherefore the\\nfame of her virtue shall never perish, but the immortals\\nwill make a gracious song in the ears of men on earth to\\nthe fame of constant Penelope. In far other wise did the\\ndaughter of Tyndareus devise ill deeds, and slay her wedded\\nlord, and hateful shall the song of her be among men, and\\nan evil repute hath she brought upon all womankind, even on\\nthe upright.\\'\\n\\nEven so these twain spake one to the other, standing in the\\nhouse of Hades, beneath the secret places of the earth.\\n\\nNow when those others had gone down from the city, quickly\\nthey came to the rich and well-ordered farm land of\\nLaertes, that he had won for himself of old, as the prize\\nof great toil in war. There was his house, and all about it\\nran the huts wherein the thralls were wont to eat and dwell\\nand sleep, bondsmen that worked his will. And in the house\\nthere was an old Sicilian woman, who diligently cared for\\nthe old man, in the upland far from the city. There\\nOdysseus spake to his thralls and to his son, saying:\\n\\n\\'Do ye now get you within the well-builded house, and\\nquickly sacrifice the best of the swine for the midday\\nmeal, but I will make trial of my father, whether he will\\nknow me again and be aware of me when he sees me, or know\\nme not, so long have I been away,\\'\\n\\nTherewith he gave the thralls his weapons of war. Then they\\nwent speedily to the house, while Odysseus drew near to the\\nfruitful vineyard to make trial of his father. Now he found\\nnot Dolius there, as he went down into the great garden,\\nnor any of the thralls nor of their sons. It chanced that\\nthey had all gone to gather stones for a garden fence, and\\nthe old man at their head. So he found his father alone in\\nthe terraced vineyard, digging about a plant. He was\\nclothed in a filthy doublet, patched and unseemly, with\\nclouted leggings of oxhide bound about his legs, against\\nthe scratches of the thorns, and long sleeves over his\\nhands by reason of the brambles, and on his head he wore a\\ngoatskin cap, and so he nursed his sorrow. Now when the\\nsteadfast goodly Odysseus saw his father thus wasted with\\nage and in great grief of heart, he stood still beneath a\\ntall pear tree and let fall a tear. Then he communed with\\nhis heart and soul, whether he should fall on his father\\'s\\nneck and kiss him, and tell him all, how he had returned\\nand come to his own country, or whether he should first\\nquestion him and prove him in every word. And as he thought\\nwithin himself, this seemed to him the better way, namely,\\nfirst to prove his father and speak to him sharply. So with\\nthis intent the goodly Odysseus went up to him. Now he was\\nholding his head down and kept digging about the plant,\\nwhile his renowned son stood by him and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Old man, thou hast no lack of skill in tending a garden;\\nlo, thou carest well for all, {*} nor is there aught\\nwhatsoever, either plant or fig-tree, or vine, yea, or\\nolive, or pear, or garden-bed in all the close, that is not\\nwell seen to. Yet another thing will I tell thee and lay\\nnot up wrath thereat in thy heart. Thyself art scarce so\\nwell cared for, but a pitiful old age is on thee, and\\nwithal thou art withered and unkempt, and clad unseemly. It\\ncannot be to punish thy sloth that thy master cares not for\\nthee; there shows nothing of the slave about thy face and\\nstature, for thou art like a kingly man, even like one who\\nshould lie soft, when he has washed and eaten well, as is\\nthe manner of the aged. But come declare me this and\\nplainly tell it all. Whose thrall art thou, and whose\\ngarden dost thou tend? Tell me moreover truly, that I may\\nsurely know, if it be indeed to Ithaca that I am now come,\\nas one yonder told me who met with me but now on the way\\nhither. He was but of little understanding, for he deigned\\nnot to tell me all nor to heed my saying, when I questioned\\nhim concerning my friend, whether indeed he is yet alive or\\nis even now dead and within the house of Hades. For I will\\ndeclare it and do thou mark and listen: once did I kindly\\nentreat a man in mine own dear country, who came to our\\nhome, and never yet has any mortal been dearer of all the\\nstrangers that have drawn to my house from afar. He\\ndeclared him to be by lineage from out of Ithaca, and said\\nthat his own father was Laertes son of Arceisius. So I led\\nhim to our halls and gave him good entertainment, with all\\nloving-kindness, out of the plenty that was within. Such\\ngifts too I gave him as are the due of guests; of well\\nwrought gold I gave him seven talents, and a mixing bowl of\\nflowered work, all of silver, and twelve cloaks of single\\nfold, and as many coverlets, and as many goodly mantles and\\ndoublets to boot, and besides all these, four women skilled\\nin all fair works and most comely, the women of his\\nchoice.\\'\\n\\n{* Supplying [Greek] from the preceding clause as object to\\n[Greek]. Other constructions are possible.}\\n\\nThen his father answered him, weeping: \\'Stranger, thou art\\nverily come to that country whereof thou askest, but\\noutrageous men and froward hold it. And these thy gifts,\\nthy countless gifts, thou didst bestow in vain. For if thou\\nhadst found that man yet living in the land of Ithaca he\\nwould have sent thee on thy way with good return of thy\\npresents, and with all hospitality, as is due to the man\\nthat begins the kindness. But come, declare me this and\\nplainly tell me all; how many years are passed since thou\\ndidst entertain him, thy guest ill-fated and my child,--if\\never such an one there was,--hapless man, whom far from his\\nfriends and his country\\'s soil, the fishes, it may be, have\\ndevoured in the deep sea, or on the shore he has fallen the\\nprey of birds and beasts. His mother wept not over him nor\\nclad him for burial, nor his father, we that begat him. Nor\\ndid his bride, whom men sought with rich gifts, the\\nconstant Penelope, bewail her lord upon the bier, as was\\nmeet, nor closed his eyes, as is the due of the departed.\\nMoreover, tell me this truly, that I may surely know, who\\nart thou and whence of the sons of men? Where is thy city\\nand where are they that begat thee? Where now is thy swift\\nship moored, that brought thee thither with thy godlike\\ncompany? Hast thou come as a passenger on another\\'s ship,\\nwhile they set thee ashore and went away?\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered him, saying: \\'Yea\\nnow, I will tell thee all most plainly. From out of Alybas\\nI come, where I dwell in a house renowned, and am the son\\nof Apheidas the son of Polypemon, the prince, and my own\\nname is Eperitus. But some god drave me wandering hither\\nfrom Sicania against my will, and yonder my ship is moored\\ntoward the upland away from the city. But for Odysseus,\\nthis is now the fifth year since he went thence and\\ndeparted out of my country. Ill-fated was he, and yet he\\nhad birds of good omen when he fared away, birds on the\\nright; wherefore I sped him gladly on his road, and gladly\\nhe departed, and the heart of us twain hoped yet to meet in\\nfriendship on a day and to give splendid gifts.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and on the old man fell a black cloud of\\nsorrow. With both his hands he clutched the dust and ashes\\nand showered them on his gray head, with ceaseless\\ngroaning. Then the heart of Odysseus was moved, and up\\nthrough his nostrils throbbed anon the keen sting of sorrow\\nat the sight of his dear father. And he sprang towards him\\nand fell on his neck and kissed him, saying:\\n\\n\\'Behold, I here, even I, my father, am the man of whom thou\\naskest; in the twentieth year am I come to mine own\\ncountry. But stay thy weeping and tearful lamentation, for\\nI will tell thee all clearly, though great need there is of\\nhaste. I have slain the wooers in our halls and avenged\\ntheir bitter scorn and evil deeds.\\'\\n\\nThen Laertes answered him and spake, saying: \\'If thou art\\nindeed Odysseus, mine own child, that art come hither, show\\nme now a manifest token, that I may be assured.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: \\'Look\\nfirst on this scar and consider it, that the boar dealt me\\nwith his white tusk on Parnassus, whither I had gone, and\\nthou didst send me forth, thou and my lady mother, to\\nAutolycus my mother\\'s father, to get the gifts which when\\nhe came hither he promised and covenanted to give me. But\\ncome, and I will even tell thee the trees through all the\\nterraced garden, which thou gavest me once for mine own,\\nand I was begging of thee this and that, being but a little\\nchild, and following thee through the garden. Through these\\nvery trees we were going, and thou didst tell me the names\\nof each of them. Pear-trees thirteen thou gavest me and ten\\napple-trees and figs two-score, and, as we went, thou didst\\nname the fifty rows of vines thou wouldest give me, whereof\\neach one ripened at divers times, with all manner of\\nclusters on their boughs, when the seasons of Zeus wrought\\nmightily on them from on high.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and straightway his knees were loosened, and\\nhis heart melted within him, as he knew the sure tokens\\nthat Odysseus showed him. About his dear son he cast his\\narms, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus caught him fainting\\nto his breast. Now when he had got breath and his spirit\\ncame to him again, once more he answered and spake, saying:\\n\\n\\'Father Zeus, verily ye gods yet bear sway on high Olympus,\\nif indeed the wooers have paid for their infatuate pride!\\nBut now my heart is terribly afraid, lest straightway all\\nthe men of Ithaca come up against us here, and haste to\\nsend messengers everywhere to the cities of the\\nCephallenians.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: \\'Take\\ncourage, and let not thy heart be careful about these\\nmatters. But come, let us go to the house that lies near\\nthe garden, for thither I sent forward Telemachus and the\\nneatherd and the swineherd to get ready the meal as\\nspeedily as may be.\\'\\n\\nAfter these words the twain set out to the goodly halls.\\nNow when they had come to the fair-lying house, they found\\nTelemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd carving much\\nflesh, and mixing the dark wine. Meanwhile the Sicilian\\nhandmaid bathed high-hearted Laertes in his house, and\\nanointed him with olive-oil, and cast a fair mantle about\\nhim. Then Athene drew nigh, and made greater the limbs of\\nthe shepherd of the people, taller she made him than before\\nand mightier to behold. Then he went forth from the bath,\\nand his dear son marvelled at him, beholding him like to\\nthe deathless gods in presence. And uttering his voice he\\nspake to him winged words:\\n\\n\\'Father, surely one of the gods that are from everlasting\\nhath made thee goodlier and greater to behold.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Laertes answered him, saying: \\'Ah, would to\\nfather Zeus and Athene and Apollo, that such as I was when\\nI took Nericus, the stablished castle on the foreland of\\nthe continent, being then the prince of the Cephallenians,\\nwould that in such might, and with mail about my shoulders,\\nI had stood to aid thee yesterday in our house, and to beat\\nback the wooers; so should I have loosened the knees of\\nmany an one of them in the halls, and thou shouldest have\\nbeen gladdened in thine inmost heart!\\'\\n\\nSo they spake each with the other. But when the others had\\nceased from their task and made ready the feast, they sat\\ndown all orderly on chairs and on high seats. Then they\\nbegan to put forth their hands on the meat, and the old man\\nDolius drew nigh, and the old man\\'s sons withal came tired\\nfrom their labour in the fields, for their mother, the aged\\nSicilian woman, had gone forth and called them, she that\\nsaw to their living and diligently cared for the old man,\\nnow that old age had laid hold on him. So soon as they\\nlooked on Odysseus and took knowledge of him, they stood\\nstill in the halls in great amazement. But Odysseus\\naddressed them in gentle words, saying:\\n\\n\\'Old man, sit down to meat and do ye forget your\\nmarvelling, for long have we been eager to put forth our\\nhands on the food, as we abode in the hall alway expecting\\nyour coming.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and Dolius ran straight toward him stretching\\nforth both his hands, and he grasped the hand of Odysseus\\nand kissed it on the wrist, and uttering his voice spake to\\nhim winged words:\\n\\n\\'Beloved, forasmuch as thou hast come back to us who sore\\ndesired thee, and no longer thought to see thee, and the\\ngods have led thee home again;--hail to thee and welcome\\nmanifold, and may the gods give thee all good fortune!\\nMoreover tell me this truly, that I may be assured, whether\\nwise Penelope yet knows well that thou hast come back\\nhither, or whether we shall dispatch a messenger.\\'\\n\\nThen Odysseus of many counsels answered saying: \\'Old man,\\nalready she knows all; what need to busy thyself herewith?\\'\\n\\nThereon the other sat him down again on his polished\\nsettle. And in like wise the sons of Dolius gathered about\\nthe renowned Odysseus, and greeted him well and clasped his\\nhands, and then sat down all orderly by Dolius their\\nfather.\\n\\nSo they were busy with the meal in the halls. Now Rumour\\nthe messenger went swiftly all about the city, telling the\\ntale of the dire death and fate of the wooers. And the\\npeople heard it, and all at once gathered together from\\nevery side with sighing and groaning before the house of\\nOdysseus. And each brought forth his dead from the halls,\\nand buried them; but those that came out of other cities\\nthey placed on swift ships and sent with fisherfolk, each\\nto be carried to his own home. As for them they all fared\\ntogether to the assembly-place, in sorrow of heart. When\\nthey were all gathered and come together, Eupeithes arose\\nand spake among them, for a comfortless grief lay heavy on\\nhis heart for his son Antinous, the first man that goodly\\nOdysseus had slain. Weeping for him he made harangue and\\nspake among them:\\n\\n\\'Friends, a great deed truly hath this man devised against\\nthe Achaeans. Some with his ships he led away, many men,\\nand noble, and his hollow ships hath he lost, and utterly\\nlost of his company, and others again, and those far the\\nbest of the Cephallenians he hath slain on his coming home.\\nUp now, before ever he gets him swiftly either to Pylos or\\nto fair Elis, where the Epeians bear sway, let us go forth;\\nelse even hereafter shall we have shame of face for ever.\\nFor a scorn this is even for the ears of men unborn to\\nhear, if we avenge not ourselves on the slayers of our sons\\nand of our brethren. Life would no more be sweet to me, but\\nrather would I die straightway and be with the departed.\\nUp, let us be going, lest these fellows be beforehand with\\nus and get them over the sea.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake weeping, and pity fell on all the Achaeans.\\nThen came near to them Medon and the divine minstrel, forth\\nfrom the halls of Odysseus, for that sleep had let them go.\\nThey stood in the midst of the gathering, and amazement\\nseized every man. Then Medon, wise of heart, spake among\\nthem, saying:\\n\\n\\'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, for surely Odysseus\\nplanned not these deeds without the will of the gods. Nay I\\nmyself beheld a god immortal, who stood hard by Odysseus,\\nin the perfect semblance of Mentor; now as a deathless god\\nwas he manifest in front of Odysseus, cheering him, and yet\\nagain scaring the wooers he stormed through the hall, and\\nthey fell thick one on another.\\'\\n\\nThus he spake, and pale fear gat hold of the limbs of all.\\nThen the old man, the lord Halitherses, spake among them,\\nthe son of Mastor, for he alone saw before and after. Out\\nof his good will be made harangue and spake among them,\\nsaying:\\n\\n\\'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I\\nwill say. Through your own cowardice, my friends, have\\nthese deeds come to pass. For ye obeyed not me, nor Mentor,\\nthe shepherd of the people, to make your sons cease from\\ntheir foolish ways. A great villainy they wrought in their\\nevil infatuation, wasting the wealth and holding in no\\nregard the wife of a prince, while they deemed that he\\nwould never more come home. And now let things be on this\\nwise, and obey my counsel. Let us not go forth against him,\\nlest haply some may find a bane of their own bringing.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, but they leapt up with a great cry, the more\\npart of them, while the rest abode there together; for his\\ncounsel was not to the mind of the more part, but they gave\\near to Eupeithes, and swiftly thereafter they rushed for\\ntheir armour. So when they had arrayed them in shining\\nmail, they assembled together in front of the spacious\\ntown. And Eupeithes led them in his witlessness, for he\\nthought to avenge the slaying of his son, yet himself was\\nnever to return, but then and there to meet his doom.\\n\\nNow Athene spake to Zeus, the son of Cronos, saying: \\'O\\nFather, our father Cronides, throned in the highest, answer\\nand tell me what is now the hidden counsel of thy heart?\\nWilt thou yet further rouse up evil war and the terrible\\ndin of battle, or art thou minded to set them at one again\\nin friendship?\\'\\n\\nThen Zeus, the gatherer of the clouds, answered her saying:\\n\\'My child, why dost thou thus straitly question me, and ask\\nme this? Nay didst not thou thyself devise this very\\nthought, namely, that Odysseus should indeed take vengeance\\non these men at his coming? Do as thou wilt, but I will\\ntell thee of the better way. Now that goodly Odysseus hath\\nwreaked vengeance on the wooers, let them make a firm\\ncovenant together with sacrifice, and let him be king all\\nhis days, and let us bring about oblivion of the slaying of\\ntheir children and their brethren; so may both sides love\\none another as of old, and let peace and wealth abundant be\\ntheir portion.\\'\\n\\nTherewith he roused Athene to yet greater eagerness, and\\nfrom the peaks of Olympus she came glancing down.\\n\\nNow when they had put from them the desire of honey-sweet\\nfood, the steadfast goodly Odysseus began to speak among\\nthem, saying:\\n\\n\\'Let one go forth and see, lest the people be already\\ndrawing near against us.\\'\\n\\nSo he spake, and the son of Dolius went forth at his\\nbidding, and stood on the outer threshold and saw them all\\nclose at hand. Then straightway he spake to Odysseus winged\\nwords:\\n\\n\\'Here they be, close upon us! Quick, let us to arms!\\'\\n\\nThereon they rose up and arrayed them in their harness,\\nOdysseus and his men being four, and the six sons of\\nDolius, and likewise Laertes and Dolius did on their\\narmour, grey-headed as they were, warriors through stress\\nof need. Now when they had clad them in shining mail, they\\nopened the gates and went forth and Odysseus led them.\\n\\nThen Athene, daughter of Zeus, drew near them in the\\nlikeness of Mentor, in fashion and in voice. And the\\nsteadfast goodly Odysseus beheld her and was glad, and\\nstraightway he spake to Telemachus his dear son:\\n\\n\\'Telemachus, soon shalt thou learn this, when thou thyself\\nart got to the place of the battle where the best men try\\nthe issue,--namely, not to bring shame on thy father\\'s\\nhouse, on us who in time past have been eminent for might\\nand hardihood over all the world.\\'\\n\\nThen wise Telemachus answered him, saying: \\'Thou shalt see\\nme, if thou wilt, dear father, in this my mood no whit\\ndisgracing thy line, according to thy word.\\'\\n\\nSo spake he, and Laertes was glad and spake, saying: \\'What\\na day has dawned for me, kind gods; yea, a glad man am I!\\nMy son and my son\\'s son are vying with one another in\\nvalour.\\'\\n\\nThen grey-eyed Athene stood beside Laertes, and spake to\\nhim: \\'O son of Arceisius that art far the dearest of all my\\nfriends, pray first to the grey-eyed maid and to father\\nZeus, then swing thy long spear aloft and hurl its\\nstraightway.\\'\\n\\nTherewith Pallas Athene breathed into him great strength.\\nThen he prayed to the daughter of mighty Zeus, and\\nstraightway swung his long spear aloft and hurled it, and\\nsmote Eupeithes through his casque with the cheek-piece of\\nbronze. The armour kept not out the spear that went clean\\nthrough, and he fell with a crash, and his arms rattled\\nabout his body. Then Odysseus and his renowned son fell on\\nthe fore-fighters, and smote them with swords and\\ntwo-headed spears. And now would they have slain them all\\nand cut off their return, had not Athene called aloud, the\\ndaughter of Zeus lord of the aegis, and stayed all the host\\nof the enemy, saying:\\n\\n\\'Hold your hands from fierce fighting, ye men of Ithaca,\\nthat so ye may be parted quickly, without bloodshed.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Athene, and pale fear gat hold of them all. The\\narms flew from their hands in their terror and fell all\\nupon the ground, as the goddess uttered her voice. To the\\ncity they turned their steps, as men fain of life, and the\\nsteadfast goodly Odysseus with a terrible cry gathered\\nhimself together and hurled in on them, like an eagle of\\nlofty flight. Then in that hour the son of Cronos cast\\nforth a flaming bolt, and it fell at the feet of the\\ngrey-eyed goddess, the daughter of the mighty Sire. Then\\ngrey-eyed Athene spake to Odysseus, saying:\\n\\n\\'Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many\\ndevices, refrain thee now and stay the strife of\\neven-handed war, lest perchance the son of Cronos be angry\\nwith thee, even Zeus of the far-borne voice.\\'\\n\\nSo spake Athene, and he obeyed and was glad at heart. And\\nthereafter Pallas Athene set a covenant between them with\\nsacrifice, she, the daughter of Zeus lord of the aegis, in\\nthe likeness of Mentor, both in fashion and in voice.\\n\\n\\n Homer, thy song men liken to the sea,\\n     With every note of music in his tone,\\n     With tides that wash the dim dominion\\n Of Hades, and light waves that laugh in glee\\n Around the isles enchanted: nay, to me\\n     Thy verse seems as the River of source unknown\\n     That glasses Egypt\\'s temples overthrown,\\n In his sky-nurtur\\'d stream, eternally.\\n No wiser we than men of heretofore\\n     To find thy mystic fountains guarded fast;\\n Enough--thy flood makes green our human shore\\n     As Nilus, Egypt, rolling down his vast,\\n His fertile waters, murmuring evermore\\n     Of gods dethroned, and empires of the Past.\\n\\nA.

      "\n",
      "There would have been less controversy about the proper\n",
      "method of Homeric translation, if critics had recognised\n",
      "that the question is a purely relative one, that of Homer\n",
      "there can be no final translation. The taste and the\n",
      "literary habits of each age demand different qualities in\n",
      "poetry, and therefore a different sort of rendering of\n",
      "Homer. To the men of the time of Elizabeth, Homer would\n",
      "have appeared bald, it seems, and lacking in ingenuity, if\n",
      "he had been presented in his antique simplicity. For the\n",
      "Elizabethan age, Chapman supplied what was then necessary,\n",
      "and the mannerisms that were then deemed of the essence of\n",
      "poetry, namely, daring and luxurious conceits. Thus in\n",
      "Chapman's verse Troy must 'shed her towers for tears of\n",
      "overthrow,' and when the winds toss Odysseus about, their\n",
      "sport must be called 'the horrid tennis.'\n",
      "\n",
      "In the age of Anne, 'dignity' and 'correctness' had to be\n",
      "given to Homer, and Pope gave them by aid of his dazzling\n",
      "rhetoric, his antitheses, his _netteté_, his command of every\n",
      "conventional and favourite artifice. Without Chapman's\n",
      "conceits, Homer's poems would hardly have been what the\n",
      "Elizabethans took for poetry; without Pope's smoothness,\n",
      "and Pope's points, the Iliad and Odyssey would have seemed\n",
      "rude, and harsh in the age of Anne. These great\n",
      "translations must always live as English poems. As\n",
      "transcripts of Homer they are like pictures drawn from a\n",
      "lost point of view. Chaque siecle depuis le xvi a ue de ce\n",
      "cote son belveder different. Again, when Europe woke to a\n",
      "sense, an almost exaggerated and certainly uncritical\n",
      "sense, of the value of her songs of the people, of all the\n",
      "ballads that Herder, Scott, Lonnrot, and the rest\n",
      "collected, it was commonly said that Homer was a\n",
      "ballad-minstrel, that the translator must imitate the\n",
      "simplicity, and even adopt the formulae of the ballad.\n",
      "Hence came the renderings of Maginn, the experiments of Mr.\n",
      "Gladstone, and others. There was some excuse for the error\n",
      "of critics who asked for a Homer in ballad rhyme. The Epic\n",
      "poet, the poet of gods and heroes, did indeed inherit some\n",
      "of the formulae of the earlier Volks-lied. Homer, like the\n",
      "author of The Song of Roland, like the singers of the\n",
      "Kalevala, uses constantly recurring epithets, and repeats,\n",
      "word for word, certain emphatic passages, messages, and so\n",
      "on. That custom is essential in the ballad, it is an\n",
      "accident not the essence of the epic. The epic is a poem of\n",
      "complete and elaborate art, but it still bears some\n",
      "birthmarks, some signs of the early popular chant, out of\n",
      "which it sprung, as the garden-rose springs from the wild\n",
      "stock, When this is recognised the demand for ballad-like\n",
      "simplicity and 'ballad-slang' ceases to exist, and then all\n",
      "Homeric translations in the ballad manner cease to\n",
      "represent our conception of Homer. After the belief in the\n",
      "ballad manner follows the recognition of the romantic vein\n",
      "in Homer, and, as a result, came Mr. Worsley's admirable\n",
      "Odyssey. This masterly translation does all that can be\n",
      "done for the Odyssey in the romantic style. The smoothness\n",
      "of the verse, the wonderful closeness to the original,\n",
      "reproduce all of Homer, in music and in meaning, that can\n",
      "be rendered in English verse. There still, however, seems\n",
      "an aspect Homeric poems, and a demand in connection with\n",
      "Homer to be recognised, and to be satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sainte-Beuve says, with reference probably to M. Leconte de\n",
      "Lisle's prose version of the epics, that some people treat\n",
      "the epics too much as if the were sagas. Now the Homeric\n",
      "epics are sagas, but then they are the sagas of the divine\n",
      "heroic age of Greece, and thus are told with an art which\n",
      "is not the art of the Northern poets. The epics are stories\n",
      "about the adventures of men living in most respects like\n",
      "the men of our own race who dwelt in Iceland, Norway,\n",
      "Denmark, and Sweden. The epics are, in a way, and as far as\n",
      "manners and institutions are concerned, historical\n",
      "documents. Whoever regards them in this way, must wish to\n",
      "read them exactly as they have reached us, without modern\n",
      "ornament, with nothing added or omitted. He must recognise,\n",
      "with Mr. Matthew Arnold, that what he now wants, namely,\n",
      "the simple truth about the matter of the poem, can only be\n",
      "given in prose, 'for in a verse translation no original\n",
      "work is any longer recognisable.' It is for this reason\n",
      "that we have attempted to tell once more, in simple prose,\n",
      "the story of Odysseus. We have tried to transfer, not all\n",
      "the truth about the poem, but the historical truth, into\n",
      "English. In this process Homer must lose at least half his\n",
      "charm, his bright and equable speed, the musical current of\n",
      "that narrative, which, like the river of Egypt, flows from\n",
      "an indiscoverable source, and mirrors the temples and the\n",
      "palaces of unforgotten gods and kings. Without this music\n",
      "of verse, only a half truth about Homer can be told, but\n",
      "then it is that half of the truth which, at this moment, it\n",
      "seems most necessary to tell. This is the half of the truth\n",
      "that the translators who use verse cannot easily tell. They\n",
      "MUST be adding to Homer, talking with Pope about 'tracing\n",
      "the mazy lev'ret o'er the lawn,' or with Mr. Worsley about\n",
      "the islands that are 'stars of the blue Aegaean,' or with\n",
      "Dr. Hawtrey about 'the earth's soft arms,' when Homer says\n",
      "nothing at all about the 'mazy lev'ret,' or the 'stars of\n",
      "the blue Aegaean,' or the 'soft arms' of earth. It would be\n",
      "impertinent indeed to blame any of these translations in\n",
      "their place. They give that which the romantic reader of\n",
      "poetry, or the student of the age of Anne, looks for in\n",
      "verse; and without tags of this sort, a translation of\n",
      "Homer in verse cannot well be made to hold together.\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be then, it appears, no final English translation\n",
      "of Homer. In each there must be, in addition to what is\n",
      "Greek and eternal, the element of what is modern, personal,\n",
      "and fleeting. Thus we trust that there may be room for 'the\n",
      "pale and far-off shadow of a prose translation,' of which\n",
      "the aim is limited and humble. A prose translation cannot\n",
      "give the movement and the fire of a successful translation\n",
      "in verse; it only gathers, as it were, the crumbs which\n",
      "fall from the richer table, only tells the story, without\n",
      "the song. Yet to a prose translation is permitted, perhaps,\n",
      "that close adherence to the archaisms of the epic, which in\n",
      "verse become mere oddities. The double epithets, the\n",
      "recurring epithets of Homer, if rendered into verse, delay\n",
      "and puzzle the reader, as the Greek does not delay or\n",
      "puzzle him. In prose he may endure them, or even care to\n",
      "study them as the survivals of a stage of taste, which is\n",
      "to be found in its prime in the sagas. These double and\n",
      "recurring epithets of Homer are a softer form of the quaint\n",
      "Northern periphrases, which make the sea the 'swan's bath,'\n",
      "gold, the 'dragon's hoard,' men, the 'ring-givers,' and so\n",
      "on. We do not know whether it is necessary to defend our\n",
      "choice of a somewhat antiquated prose. Homer has no ideas\n",
      "which cannot be expressed in words that are 'old and\n",
      "plain,' and to words that are old and plain, and, as a\n",
      "rule, to such terms as, being used by the Translators of\n",
      "the Bible, are still not unfamiliar, we have tried to\n",
      "restrict ourselves. It may be objected, that the employment\n",
      "of language which does not come spontaneously to the lips,\n",
      "is an affectation out of place in a version of the Odyssey.\n",
      "To this we may answer that the Greek Epic dialect, like the\n",
      "English of our Bible, was a thing of slow growth and\n",
      "composite nature, that it was never a spoken language, nor,\n",
      "except for certain poetical purposes, a written language.\n",
      "Thus the Biblical English seems as nearly analogous to the\n",
      "Epic Greek, as anything that our tongue has to offer.\n",

      "reading. The notes at the end, which we would like to have\n",
      "written in the form of essays, and in company with more\n",
      "complete philological and archaeological studies, are\n",

      "war. As to the actual history of that war, it may be said\n",
      "that nothing is known. We may conjecture that some contest\n",
      "between peoples of more or less kindred stocks, who\n",
      "occupied the isles and the eastern and western shores of\n",
      "the Aegean, left a strong impression on the popular fancy.\n",
      "Round the memories of this contest would gather many older\n",
      "legends, myths, and stories, not peculiarly Greek or even\n",
      "'Aryan,' which previously floated unattached, or were\n",
      "connected with heroes whose fame was swallowed up by that\n",
      "of a newer generation. It would be the work of minstrels,\n",
      "priests, and poets, as the national spirit grew conscious\n",
      "of itself, to shape all these materials into a definite\n",
      "body of tradition. This is the rule of development--first\n",
      "scattered stories, then the union of these into a NATIONAL\n",
      "legend. The growth of later national legends, which we are\n",
      "able to trace, historically, has generally come about in\n",
      "this fashion. To take the best known example, we are able\n",
      "to compare the real history of Charlemagne with the old\n",
      "epic poems on his life and exploits. In these poems we find\n",
      "that facts are strangely exaggerated, and distorted; that\n",
      "purely fanciful additions are made to the true records,\n",
      "that the more striking events of earlier history are\n",
      "crowded into the legend of Charles, that mere fairy tales,\n",
      "current among African as well as European peoples, are\n",
      "transmuted into false history, and that the anonymous\n",
      "characters of fairy tales are converted into historical\n",
      "personages. We can also watch the process by which feigned\n",
      "genealogies were constructed, which connected the princely\n",
      "houses of France with the imaginary heroes of the epics.\n",
      "The conclusion is that the poetical history of Charlemagne\n",
      "has only the faintest relations to the true history. And we\n",
      "are justified in supposing that, quite as little of the\n",

      "Troy, as from the Chansons de Geste.\n",

      "By the time the Odyssey was composed, it is certain that a\n",
      "poet had before him a well-arranged mass of legends and\n",

      "author of the Iliad has an extremely full and curiously\n",
      "consistent knowledge of the local traditions of Greece, the\n",

      "of Mycenae, of Argos, and so on. The Iliad and the Odyssey\n",
      "assume this knowledge in the hearers of the poems, and take\n",
      "for granted some acquaintance with other legends, as with\n",
      "the story of the Argonautic Expedition. Now that story\n",
      "itself is a tissue of popular tales,--still current in many\n",

      "The history of the return of Odysseus as told in the\n",

      "which is a marvel of construction.\n",

      "Odysseus was the King of Ithaca, a small and rugged island\n",
      "on the western coast of Greece. When he was but lately\n",
      "married to Penelope, and while his only son Telemachus was\n",
      "still an infant, the Trojan war began. It is scarcely\n",

      "disposal. No prince came to the leaguer of Troy from a home\n",
      "more remote than that of Odysseus. When Troy was taken, in\n",
      "the tenth year of the war, his homeward voyage was the\n",
      "longest and most perilous.\n",
      "\n",
      "The action of the Odyssey occupies but the last six weeks\n",
      "of the ten years during which Odysseus was wandering. Two\n",
      "nights in these six weeks are taken up, however, by his own\n",
      "narrative of his adventures (to the Phaeacians, p. xx) in\n",
      "the previous ten years. With this explanatory narrative we\n",
      "must begin, before coming to the regular action of the\n",
      "poem.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the fall of Troy, Odysseus touched at Ismarus, the\n",
      "city of a Thracian people, whom he attacked and plundered,\n",
      "but by whom he was at last repulsed. The north wind then\n",
      "carried his ships to Malea, the extreme southern point of\n",
      "Greece. Had he doubled Malea safely, he would probably have\n",
      "reached Ithaca in a few days, would have found Penelope\n",
      "unvexed by wooers, and Telemachus a boy of ten years old.\n",
      "But this was not to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'ruinous winds' drove Odysseus and his ships for ten\n",
      "days, and on the tenth they touched the land of the Lotus-\n",
      "Eaters, whose flowery food causes sweet forgetfulness.\n",
      "Lotus-land was possibly in Western Libya, but it is more\n",
      "probable that ten days' voyage from the southern point of\n",
      "Greece, brought Odysseus into an unexplored region of\n",
      "fairy-land. Egypt, of which Homer had some knowledge, was\n",
      "but five days' sail from Crete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lotus-land, therefore, being ten days' sail from Malea, was\n",
      "well over the limit of the discovered world. From this\n",
      "country Odysseus went on till he reached the land of the\n",
      "lawless Cyclopes, a pastoral people of giants. Later Greece\n",
      "feigned that the Cyclopes dwelt near Mount Etna, in Sicily.\n",
      "Homer leaves their place of abode in the vague.  Among the\n",
      "Cyclopes, Odysseus had the adventure on which his whole\n",
      "fortunes hinged. He destroyed the eye of the cannibal\n",
      "giant, Polyphemus, a son of Poseidon, the God of the Sea.\n",
      "To avenge this act, Poseidon drove Odysseus wandering for\n",
      "ten long years, and only suffered him to land in Ithaca,\n",
      "'alone, in evil case, to find troubles in his house.' This\n",
      "is a very remarkable point in the plot. The story of the\n",
      "crafty adventurer and the blinding of the giant, with the\n",
      "punning device by which the hero escaped, exists in the\n",
      "shape of a detached marchen or fairy-tale among races who\n",
      "never heard of Homer. And when we find the story among\n",
      "Oghuzians, Esthonians, Basques, and Celts, it seems natural\n",
      "to suppose that these people did not break a fragment out\n",
      "of the Odyssey, but that the author of the Odyssey took\n",
      "possession of a legend out of the great traditional store\n",
      "of fiction. From the wide distribution of the tale, there\n",
      "is reason to suppose that it is older than Homer, and that\n",
      "it was not originally told of Odysseus, but was attached to\n",
      "his legend, as floating jests of unknown authorship are\n",
      "attributed to eminent wits. It has been remarked with truth\n",
      "that in this episode Odysseus acts out of character, that\n",
      "he is foolhardy as well as cunning. Yet the author of the\n",
      "Odyssey, so far from merely dove-tailing this story at\n",
      "random into his narrative, has made his whole plot turn on\n",
      "the injury to the Cyclops. Had he not foolishly exposed\n",
      "himself and his companions, by his visit to the Cyclops,\n",
      "Odysseus would never have been driven wandering for ten\n",

      "From the land of the Cyclops, Odysseus and his company\n",

      "most favourable gale, it was ten days' sail from Ithaca. In\n",

      "received from the king a bag in which all the winds were\n",
      "bound, except that which was to waft the hero to his home.\n",
      "This sort of bag was probably not unfamiliar to\n",

      "rushed out, the ships were borne back to the Aeolian Isle,\n",
      "and thence the hero was roughly dismissed by Aeolus. Seven\n",

      "that live by bread, to each one as he will. As for him it\n",
      "is no blame if he sings the ill-faring of the Danaans; for\n",

      "both word and work. Nor, if this be so, shall thy voyage be\n",
      "vain or unfulfilled. But if thou art not the very seed of\n",
      "him and of Penelope, then have I no hope that thou wilt\n",
      "accomplish thy desire. For few children, truly, are like\n",
      "their father; lo, the more part are worse, yet a few are\n",
      "better than the sire. But since thou shalt not even\n",
      "hereafter be craven or witless, nor hath the wisdom of\n",

      "ready corn, and bestow all in vessels, the wine in jars and\n",
      "barley-flour, the marrow of men, in well-sewn skins; and I\n",
      "will lightly gather in the township a crew that offer\n",
      "themselves willingly. There are many ships, new and old, in\n",

      "Antinous, lightly, and all the while the wooers were busy\n",
      "feasting through the house; and they mocked him and sharply\n",
      "taunted him, and thus would some proud youth speak:\n",

      "mother to possess it, and to him whosoever should wed her.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake they; but he stepped down into the vaulted\n",
      "treasure-chamber of his father, a spacious room, where gold\n",
      "and bronze lay piled, and raiment in coffers, and fragrant\n",
      "olive oil in plenty. And there stood casks of sweet wine\n",
      "and old, full of the unmixed drink divine, all orderly\n",
      "ranged by the wall, ready if ever Odysseus should come\n",
      "home, albeit after travail and much pain. And the\n",
      "close-fitted doors, the folding doors, were shut, and night\n",
      "and day there abode within a dame in charge, who guarded\n",
      "all in the fulness of her wisdom, Eurycleia, daughter of\n",
      "Ops son of Peisenor. Telemachus now called her into the\n",

      "and pour me barley-meal into well-sewn skins, and let there\n",
      "be twenty measures of the grain of bruised barley-meal. Let\n",
      "none know this but thyself! As for these things let them\n",
      "all be got together; for in the evening I will take them\n",
      "with me, at the time that my mother hath gone to her upper\n",
      "chamber and turned her thoughts to sleep. Lo, to Sparta I\n",

      "Odysseus. Then, when the others had roasted the outer parts\n",
      "and drawn them off the spits, they divided the messes and\n",
      "shared the glorious feast. But when they had put from them\n",
      "the desire of meat and drink, Nestor of Gerenia, lord of\n",

      "have come forth out of Ithaca that is below Neion; and this\n",
      "our quest whereof I speak is a matter of mine own, and not\n",
      "of the common weal. I follow after the far-spread rumour of\n",
      "my father, if haply I may hear thereof, even of the goodly\n",
      "steadfast Odysseus, who upon a time, men say, fought by thy\n",
      "side and sacked the city of the Trojans. For of all the\n",
      "others, as many as warred with the Trojans, we hear\n",
      "tidings, and where each one fell by a pitiful death; but\n",
      "even the death of this man Cronion hath left untold. For\n",
      "none can surely declare the place where he hath perished,\n",
      "whether he was smitten by foemen on the mainland, or lost\n",
      "upon the deep among the waves of Amphitrite. So now am I\n",
      "come hither to thy knees, if perchance thou art willing to\n",
      "tell me of his pitiful death, as one that saw it with thine\n",
      "own eyes, or heard the story from some other wanderer,--\n",
      "for his mother bare him to exceeding sorrow. And speak me\n",
      "no soft words in ruth or pity, but tell me plainly what\n",
      "sight thou didst get of him. Ah! I pray thee, if ever at\n",
      "all my father, noble Odysseus, made promise to thee of word\n",
      "or work, and fulfilled the same in the land of the Trojans,\n",

      "with our ships over the misty deep, wheresoever Achilles\n",
      "led; and of all our war round the mighty burg of king\n",
      "Priam. Yea and there the best of us were slain. There lies\n",

      "peer of the gods in counsel, and there my own dear son,\n",
      "strong and noble, Antilochus, that excelled in speed of\n",
      "foot and in the fight. And many other ills we suffered\n",
      "beside these; who of mortal men could tell the tale? Nay\n",
      "none, though thou wert to abide here for five years, ay and\n",
      "for six, and ask of all the ills which the goodly Achaeans\n",
      "then endured. Ere all was told thou wouldst be weary and\n",
      "turn to thine own country. For nine whole years we were\n",
      "busy about them, devising their ruin with all manner of\n",
      "craft; and scarce did Cronion bring it to pass. There never\n",
      "a man durst match with him in wisdom, for goodly Odysseus\n",
      "very far outdid the rest in all manner of craft, Odysseus\n",
      "thy father, if indeed thou art his son,--amazement comes\n",
      "upon me as I look at thee; for verily thy speech is like\n",
      "unto his; none would say that a younger man would speak so\n",
      "like an elder. Now look you, all the while that myself and\n",
      "goodly Odysseus were there, we never spake diversely either\n",
      "in the assembly or in the council, but always were of one\n",
      "mind, and advised the Argives with understanding and sound\n",
      "counsel, how all might be for the very best. But after we\n",
      "had sacked the steep city of Priam, and had departed in our\n",
      "ships, and a god had scattered the Achaeans, even then did\n",
      "Zeus devise in his heart a pitiful returning for the\n",
      "Argives, for in no wise were they all discreet or just.\n",
      "Wherefore many of them met with an ill faring by reason of\n",
      "the deadly wrath of the grey-eyed goddess, the daughter of\n",
      "the mighty sire, who set debate between the two sons of\n",
      "Atreus. And they twain called to the gathering of the host\n",
      "all the Achaeans, recklessly and out of order, against the\n",
      "going down of the sun; and lo, the sons of the Achaeans\n",
      "came heavy with wine. And the Atreidae spake out and told\n",
      "the reason wherefore they had assembled the host. Then\n",
      "verily Menelaus charged all the Achaeans to bethink them of\n",
      "returning over the broad back of the sea, but in no sort\n",
      "did he please Agamemnon, whose desire was to keep back the\n",
      "host and to offer holy hecatombs, that so he might appease\n",
      "that dread wrath of Athene. Fool! for he knew not this,\n",
      "that she was never to be won; for the mind of the\n",
      "everlasting gods is not lightly turned to repentance. So\n",
      "these twain stood bandying hard words; but the\n",
      "goodly-greaved Achaeans sprang up with a wondrous din, and\n",
      "twofold counsels found favour among them. So that one night\n",
      "we rested, thinking hard things against each other, for\n",
      "Zeus was fashioning for us a ruinous doom. But in the\n",
      "morning, we of the one part drew our ships to the fair salt\n",
      "sea, and put aboard our wealth, and the low-girdled Trojan\n",
      "women. Now one half the people abode steadfastly there with\n",
      "Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the host; and half of\n",
      "us embarked and drave to sea and swiftly the ships sailed,\n",
      "for a god made smooth the sea with the depths thereof. And\n",
      "when we came to Tenedos, we did sacrifice to the gods,\n",
      "being eager for the homeward way; but Zeus did not yet\n",
      "purpose our returning, nay, hard was he, that roused once\n",
      "more an evil strife among us. Then some turned back their\n",
      "curved ships, and went their way, even the company of\n",
      "Odysseus, the wise and manifold in counsel, once again\n",
      "showing a favour to Agamemnon, son of Atreus. But I fled on\n",
      "with the squadron that followed me, for I knew how now the\n",
      "god imagined mischief. And the warlike son of Tydeus fled\n",
      "and roused his men thereto. And late in our track came\n",
      "Menelaus of the fair hair, who found us in Lesbos,\n",
      "considering about the long voyage, whether we should go\n",
      "sea-ward of craggy Chios, by the isle of Psyria, keeping\n",
      "the isle upon our left, or inside Chios past windy Mimas.\n",
      "So we asked the god to show us a sign, and a sign he\n",
      "declared to us, and bade us cleave a path across the middle\n",
      "sea to Euboea, that we might flee the swiftest way from\n",
      "sorrow. And a shrill wind arose and blew, and the ships ran\n",
      "most fleetly over the teeming ways, and in the night they\n",
      "touched at Geraestus. So there we sacrificed many thighs of\n",
      "bulls to Poseidon, for joy that we had measured out so\n",
      "great a stretch of sea. It was the fourth day when the\n",
      "company of Diomede son of Tydeus, tamer of horses, moored\n",
      "their gallant ships at Argos; but I held on for Pylos, and\n",
      "the breeze was never quenched from the hour that the god\n",
      "sent it forth to blow. Even so I came, dear child, without\n",
      "tidings, nor know I aught of those others, which of the\n",
      "Achaeans were saved and which were lost. But all that I\n",
      "hear tell of as I sit in our halls, thou shalt learn as it\n",
      "is meet, and I will hide nothing from thee. Safely, they\n",
      "say, came the Myrmidons the wild spearsmen, whom the famous\n",
      "son of high-souled Achilles led; and safely Philoctetes,\n",
      "the glorious son of Poias. And Idomeneus brought all his\n",
      "company to Crete, all that escaped the war, and from him\n",
      "the sea gat none. And of the son of Atreus even yourselves\n",
      "have heard, far apart though ye dwell, how he came, and how\n",
      "Aegisthus devised his evil end; but verily he himself paid\n",
      "a terrible reckoning. So good a thing it is that a son of\n",
      "the dead should still be left, even as that son also took\n",
      "vengeance on the slayer of his father, guileful Aegisthus,\n",
      "who slew his famous sire. And thou too, my friend, for I\n",
      "see thee very comely and tall, be valiant, that even men\n",
      "unborn may praise thee.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And wise Telemachus answered him, and said: 'Nestor, son of\n",

      "avenged himself, and the Achaeans shall noise his fame\n",
      "abroad, that even those may hear who are yet for to be. Oh\n",
      "that the gods would clothe me with such strength as his,\n",
      "that I might take vengeance on the wooers for their cruel\n",

      "oppression, or do the people through the land hate thee,\n",
      "obedient to the voice of a god? Who knows but that Odysseus\n",
      "may some day come and requite their violence, either\n",
      "himself alone or all the host of the Achaeans with him? Ah,\n",

      "she cared exceedingly for the renowned Odysseus in the land\n",
      "of the Trojans, where we Achaeans were sore afflicted, for\n",
      "never yet have I seen the gods show forth such manifest\n",
      "love, as then did Pallas Athene standing manifest by him,--\n",

      "Where was Menelaus? What death did crafty Aegisthus plan\n",
      "for him, in that he killed a man more valiant far than he?\n",
      "Or was Menelaus not in Argos of Achaia but wandering\n",

      "\n",
      "Then Nestor of Gerenia, lord of chariots, answered him:\n",

      "would have fallen out, if Menelaus of the fair hair, the\n",
      "son of Atreus, when he came back from Troy, had found\n",
      "Aegisthus yet alive in the halls. Then even in his death\n",
      "would they not have heaped the piled earth over him, but\n",
      "dogs and fowls of the air would have devoured him as he lay\n",
      "on the plain far from the town. {*} Nor would any of the\n",
      "Achaean women have bewailed him; so dread was the deed he\n",
      "contrived. Now we sat in leaguer there, achieving many\n",
      "adventures; but he the while in peace in the heart of\n",
      "Argos, the pastureland of horses, spake ofttimes, tempting\n",
      "her, to the wife of Agamemnon. Verily at the first she\n",
      "would none of the foul deed, the fair Clytemnestra, for she\n",
      "had a good understanding. Moreover there was with her a\n",
      "minstrel, whom the son of Atreus straitly charged as he\n",
      "went to Troy to have a care of his wife. But when at last\n",
      "the doom of the gods bound her to her ruin, then did\n",
      "Aegisthus carry the minstrel to a lonely isle, and left him\n",
      "there to be the prey and spoil of birds; while as for her,\n",
      "he led her to his house, a willing lover with a willing\n",
      "lady. And he burnt many thigh slices upon the holy altars\n",
      "of the gods, and hung up many offerings, woven-work and\n",
      "gold, seeing that he had accomplished a great deed, beyond\n",
      "all hope. Now we, I say, were sailing together on our way\n",
      "from Troy, the son of Atreus and I, as loving friends. But\n",
      "when we had reached holy Sunium, the headland of Athens,\n",
      "there Phoebus Apollo slew the pilot of Menelaus with the\n",
      "visitation of his gentle shafts, as he held between his\n",
      "hands the rudder of the running ship, even Phrontis, son of\n",
      "Onetor, who excelled the tribes of men in piloting a ship,\n",
      "whenso the storm-winds were hurrying by. Thus was Menelaus\n",
      "holden there, though eager for the way, till he might bury\n",
      "his friend and pay the last rites over him. But when he in\n",
      "his turn, faring over the wine-dark sea in hollow ships,\n",
      "reached in swift course the steep mount of Malea, then it\n",
      "was that Zeus of the far-borne voice devised a hateful\n",
      "path, and shed upon them the breath of the shrill winds,\n",
      "and great swelling waves arose like unto mountains. There\n",
      "sundered he the fleet in twain, and part thereof he brought\n",
      "nigh to Crete, where the Cydonians dwelt about the streams\n",
      "of Iardanus. Now there is a certain cliff, smooth and sheer\n",
      "towards the sea, on the border of Gortyn, in the misty\n",
      "deep, where the South-West Wind drives a great wave against\n",
      "the left headland, towards Phaestus, and a little rock\n",
      "keeps back the mighty water. Thither came one part of the\n",
      "fleet, and the men scarce escaped destruction, but the\n",
      "ships were broken by the waves against the rock; while\n",
      "those other five dark-prowed ships the wind and the water\n",
      "bare and brought nigh to Egypt. Thus Menelaus, gathering\n",
      "much livelihood and gold, was wandering there with his\n",
      "ships among men of strange speech, and even then Aegisthus\n",
      "planned that pitiful work at home. And for seven years he\n",
      "ruled over Mycenae, rich in gold, after he slew the son of\n",
      "Atreus, and the people were subdued unto him. But in the\n",
      "eighth year came upon him goodly Orestes back from Athens\n",
      "to be his bane, and slew the slayer of his father, guileful\n",
      "Aegisthus, who killed his famous sire. Now when he had\n",
      "slain him, he made a funeral feast to the Argives over his\n",
      "hateful mother, and over the craven Aegisthus. And on the\n",
      "selfsame day there came to him Menelaus of the loud\n",

      "the men into the hall divine. And they beheld and marvelled\n",
      "as they gazed throughout the palace of the king, the\n",
      "fosterling of Zeus; for there was a gleam as it were of sun\n",
      "or moon through the lofty palace of renowned Menelaus. But\n",
      "after they had gazed their fill, they went to the polished\n",
      "baths and bathed them. Now when the maidens had bathed them\n",
      "and anointed them with olive oil, and cast about them thick\n",
      "cloaks and doublets, they sat on chairs by Menelaus, son of\n",
      "Atreus. And a handmaid bare water for the hands in a goodly\n",
      "golden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin to\n",
      "wash withal; and to their side she drew a polished table,\n",
      "and a grave dame bare food and set it by them, and laid\n",
      "upon the board many dainties, giving freely of such things\n",
      "as she had by her, and a carver lifted and placed by them\n",
      "platters of divers kinds of flesh, and nigh them he set\n",
      "golden bowls. So Menelaus of the fair hair greeted the\n",
      "twain and spake:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Taste ye food and be glad, and thereafter when ye have\n",
      "supped, we will ask what men ye are; for the blood of your\n",

      "churls could beget sons like you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and took and set before them the fat ox-chine\n",
      "roasted, which they had given him as his own mess by way of\n",
      "honour. And they stretched forth their hands upon the good\n",
      "cheer set before them. Now when they had put from them the\n",
      "desire of meat and drink Telemachus spake to the son of\n",
      "Nestor, holding his head close to him, that those others\n",
      "might not hear:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Son of Nestor, delight of my heart, mark the flashing of\n",
      "bronze through the echoing halls, and the flashing of gold\n",
      "and of amber and of silver and of ivory. Such like,\n",
      "methinks, is the court of Olympian Zeus within, for the\n",
      "world of things that are here; wonder comes over me as I\n",
      "look thereon.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And as he spake Menelaus of the fair hair was ware of him,\n",
      "and uttering his voice spake to them winged words:\n",

      "'Children dear, of a truth no one of mortal men may contend\n",
      "with Zeus, for his mansions and his treasures are\n",
      "everlasting: but of men there may be who will vie with me\n",
      "in treasure, or there may be none. Yea, for after many a\n",
      "woe and wanderings manifold, I brought my wealth home in\n",
      "ships, and in the eighth year came hither. I roamed over\n",
      "Cyprus and Phoenicia and Egypt, and reached the Aethiopians\n",
      "and Sidonians and Erembi and Libya, where lambs are horned\n",
      "from the birth. For there the ewes yean thrice within the\n",
      "full circle of a year; there neither lord nor shepherd\n",
      "lacketh aught of cheese or flesh or of sweet milk, but ever\n",
      "the flocks yield store of milk continual. While I was yet\n",
      "roaming in those lands, gathering much livelihood, meantime\n",
      "another slew my brother privily, at unawares, by the guile\n",
      "of his accursed wife. Thus, look you, I have no joy of my\n",
      "lordship among these my possessions: and ye are like to\n",

      "stablished fair, and had in it much choice substance. I\n",
      "would that I had but a third part of those my riches, and\n",
      "dwelt in my halls, and that those men were yet safe, who\n",

      "for them all I make no such dole, despite my grief, as for\n",
      "one only, who causes me to loathe both sleep and meat, when\n",
      "I think upon him. For no one of the Achaeans toiled so\n",
      "greatly as Odysseus toiled and adventured himself: but to\n",
      "him it was to be but labour and trouble, and to me grief\n",
      "ever comfortless for his sake, so long he is afar, nor know\n",
      "we aught, whether he be alive or dead. Yea methinks they\n",

      "his purple mantle with both his hands before his eyes. And\n",
      "Menelaus marked him and mused in his mind and his heart\n",

      "it was that the handmaid Phylo bare and set beside her,\n",

      "He spake and withal departed to his father's house. And the\n",
      "proud spirits of these twain were angered, and they made\n",
      "the wooers sit down together and cease from their games.\n",
      "And among them spake Antinous, son of Eupeithes, in\n",
      "displeasure; and his black heart was wholly filled with\n",

      "'Out on him, a proud deed hath Telemachus accomplished with\n",
      "a high hand, even this journey, and we thought that he\n",

      "without the court and heard their purposes, while they were\n",
      "weaving their plot within. So he went on his way through\n",
      "the halls to bring the news to Penelope; and as he stept\n",
      "down over the threshold, Penelope spake unto him:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Henchman, wherefore have the noble wooers sent thee forth?\n",
      "Was it to tell the handmaids of divine Odysseus to cease\n",
      "from their work, and prepare a banquet for them? Nay, after\n",
      "thus much wooing, never again may they come together, but\n",
      "here this day sup for their last and latest time; all ye\n",
      "who assemble so often, and waste much livelihood, the\n",
      "wealth of wise Telemachus! Long ago when ye were children,\n",
      "ye marked not your fathers' telling, what manner of man was\n",
      "Odysseus among them, one that wrought no iniquity toward\n",
      "any man, nor spake aught unrighteous in the township, as is\n",
      "the wont of divine kings. One man a king is like to hate,\n",
      "another he might chance to love. But never did he do aught\n",
      "at all presumptuously to any man. Nay, it is plain what\n",
      "spirit ye are of, and your unseemly deeds are manifest to\n",
      "all, nor is there any gratitude left for kindness done.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: 'Would, oh queen,\n",
      "that this were the crowning evil! But the wooers devise\n",
      "another far greater and more grievous, which I pray the son\n",
      "of Cronos may never fulfil! They are set on slaying\n",
      "Telemachus with the edge of the sword on his homeward way;\n",
      "for he is gone to fair Pylos and goodly Lacedaemon, to seek\n",
      "tidings of his father.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, but her knees were loosened where she stood,\n",
      "and her heart melted within her, and long time was she\n",
      "speechless, and lo, her eyes were filled with tears and the\n",
      "voice of her utterance was stayed. And at the last she\n",
      "answered him and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Henchman, wherefore I pray thee is my son departed? There\n",
      "is no need that he should go abroad on swift ships, that\n",

      "upon earth?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: 'I know not\n",

      "many in the house, but there she crouched on the threshold\n",
      "of her well-builded chamber, wailing piteously, and her\n",
      "handmaids round her made low moan, as many as were in the\n",

      "that he was purposing this journey, verily he should have\n",
      "stayed here still, though eager to be gone, or have left me\n",
      "dead in the halls. Howbeit let some one make haste to call\n",
      "the ancient Dolius, my thrall, whom my father gave me ere\n",
      "yet I had come hither, who keepeth my garden of trees. So\n",

      "yet live on in the house,--yet will I not hide my saying\n",
      "from thee. I knew all this, and gave him whatsoever he\n",
      "commanded, bread and sweet wine. And he took a great oath\n",
      "of me not to tell thee till at least the twelfth day should\n",
      "come, or thou thyself shouldst miss him and hear of his\n",
      "departure, that thou mightest not mar thy fair flesh with\n",
      "thy tears. But now, wash thee in water, and take to thee\n",
      "clean raiment and ascend to thy upper chamber with the\n",
      "women thy handmaids, and pray to Athene, daughter of Zeus,\n",
      "lord of the aegis. For so may she save him even from death.\n",
      "And heap not troubles on an old man's trouble; for the seed\n",

      "\n",
      "Therewith he chose twenty men that were the best, and they\n",
      "departed to the swift ship and the sea-banks. So first of\n",
      "all they drew the ship down to the deep water, and placed\n",
      "the mast and sails in the black ship, and fixed the oars in\n",
      "leathern loops all orderly, and spread forth the white\n",
      "sails. And squires, haughty of heart, bare for them their\n",
      "arms. And they moored her high out in the shore water, and\n",
      "themselves disembarked. There they supped and waited for\n",
      "evening to come on.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the wise Penelope lay there in her upper chamber,\n",
      "fasting and tasting neither meat nor drink, musing whether\n",
      "her noble son should escape death, or even fall before the\n",
      "proud wooers. And as a lion broods all in fear among the\n",
      "press of men, when they draw the crafty ring around him, so\n",
      "deeply was she musing when deep sleep came over her. And\n",
      "she sank back in sleep and all her joints were loosened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to other\n",

      "afflicted, seeing that thy son is yet to return; for no\n",
      "sinner is he in the eyes of the gods.'\n",
      "\n",

      "softly at the gates of dreams:\n",

      "'Wherefore, sister, hast thou come hither, that before wert\n",
      "not wont to come, for thou hast thine habitation very far\n",
      "away? Biddest thou me indeed to cease from the sorrows and\n",
      "pains, so many that disquiet my heart and soul? Erewhile I\n",
      "lost my noble lord of the lion heart, adorned with all\n",
      "perfection among the Danaans, my true lord, whose fame is\n",
      "noised abroad from Hellas to mid Argos. And now, again, my\n",

      "child, not skilled in toils or in the gatherings of men.\n",
      "For him I sorrow yet more than for my lord, and I tremble\n",
      "and fear for him lest aught befal him, whether, it may be,\n",
      "amid that folk where he is gone, or in the deep. For many\n",
      "foemen devise evil against him, and go about to kill him,\n",

      "guide him, as all men pray to stand by them, for that she\n",
      "hath the power, even Pallas Athene. And she pitieth thee in\n",
      "thy sorrow, and now hath sent me forth to speak these words\n",
      "to thee.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And wise Penelope answered her, saying: 'If thou art indeed\n",
      "a god, and hast heard the word of a god, come, I pray thee,\n",
      "and tell me tidings concerning that ill-fated man, whether\n",

      "dead; it is ill to speak words light as wind.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith the phantom slipped away by the bolt of the door\n",

      "the nymph within was singing with a sweet voice as she\n",
      "fared to and fro before the loom, and wove with a shuttle\n",
      "of gold. And round about the cave there was a wood\n",
      "blossoming, alder and poplar and sweet-smelling cypress.\n",
      "And therein roosted birds long of wing, owls and falcons\n",
      "and chattering sea-crows, which have their business in the\n",

      "gadding garden vine, all rich with clusters. And fountains\n",
      "four set orderly were running with clear water, hard by one\n",
      "another, turned each to his own course. And all around soft\n",
      "meadows bloomed of violets and parsley, yea, even a\n",
      "deathless god who came thither might wonder at the sight\n",
      "and be glad at heart. There the messenger, the slayer of\n",

      "aforetime, straining his soul with tears and groans and\n",
      "griefs, and as he wept he looked wistfully over the\n",

      "I swim yet further along the coast to find, if I may, spits\n",
      "that take the waves aslant and havens of the sea, I fear\n",
      "lest the storm-winds catch me again and bear me over the\n",
      "teeming deep, making heavy moan; or else some god may even\n",
      "send forth against me a monster from out of the shore\n",
      "water; and many such pastureth the renowned Amphitrite. For\n",
      "I know how wroth against me hath been the great Shaker of\n",
      "the Earth.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst yet he pondered these things in his heart and mind,\n",
      "a great wave bore him to the rugged shore. There would he\n",
      "have been stript of his skin and all his bones been broken,\n",
      "but that the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put a thought into\n",
      "his heart. He rushed in, and with both his hands clutched\n",
      "the rock, whereto he clung till the great wave went by. So\n",
      "he escaped that peril, but again with backward wash it\n",
      "leapt on him and smote him and cast him forth into the\n",
      "deep. And as when the cuttlefish is dragged forth from his\n",
      "chamber, the many pebbles clinging to his suckers, even so\n",
      "was the skin stript from his strong hand against the rocks,\n",
      "and the great wave closed over him. There of a truth would\n",
      "luckless Odysseus have perished beyond that which was\n",
      "ordained, had not grey-eyed Athene given him sure counsel.\n",
      "He rose from the line of the breakers that belch upon the\n",
      "shore, and swam outside, ever looking landwards, to find,\n",
      "if he might, spits that take the waves aslant, and havens\n",
      "of the sea. But when he came in his swimming over against\n",
      "the mouth of a fair-flowing river, whereby the place seemed\n",
      "best in his eyes, smooth of rocks, and withal there was a\n",
      "covert from the wind, Odysseus felt the river running, and\n",
      "prayed to him in his heart:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hear me, O king, whosoever thou art; unto thee am I come,\n",
      "as to one to whom prayer is made, while I flee the rebukes\n",
      "of Poseidon from the deep. Yea, reverend even to the\n",
      "deathless gods is that man who comes as a wanderer, even as\n",
      "I now have come to thy stream and to thy knees after much\n",
      "travail. Nay pity me, O king; for I avow myself thy\n",
      "suppliant.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and the god straightway stayed his stream and\n",
      "withheld his waves, and made the water smooth before him,\n",
      "and brought him safely to the mouths of the river. And his\n",
      "knees bowed and his stout hands fell, for his heart was\n",
      "broken by the brine. And his flesh was all swollen and a\n",
      "great stream of sea water gushed up through his mouth and\n",
      "nostrils. So he lay without breath or speech, swooning,\n",
      "such terrible weariness came upon him. But when now his\n",
      "breath returned and his spirit came to him again, he loosed\n",
      "from off him the veil of the goddess, and let it fall into\n",
      "the salt flowing river. And the great wave bare it back\n",
      "down the stream, and lightly Ino caught it in her hands.\n",
      "Then Odysseus turned from the river, and fell back in the\n",
      "reeds, and kissed earth, the grain-giver, and heavily he\n",
      "spake unto his own brave spirit:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, woe is me! What is to betide me? What shall happen\n",
      "unto me at the last? If I watch the river bed all through\n",
      "the careful night, I fear that the bitter frost and fresh\n",
      "dew may overcome me, as I breathe forth my life for\n",
      "faintness, for the river breeze blows cold betimes in the\n",
      "morning. But if I climb the hill-side up to the shady wood,\n",
      "and there take rest in the thickets, though perchance the\n",
      "cold and weariness leave hold of me, and sweet sleep may\n",
      "come over me, I fear lest of wild beasts I become the spoil\n",
      "and prey.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So as he thought thereon this seemed to him the better way.\n",
      "He went up to the wood, and found it nigh the water in a\n",
      "place of wide prospect. So he crept beneath twin bushes\n",
      "that grew from one stem, both olive trees, one of them wild\n",
      "olive. Through these the force of the wet winds blew never,\n",
      "neither did the bright sun light on it with his rays, nor\n",
      "could the rain pierce through, so close were they twined\n",
      "either to other; and thereunder crept Odysseus and anon he\n",
      "heaped together with his hands a broad couch; for of fallen\n",
      "leaves there was great plenty, enough to cover two or three\n",
      "men in winter time, however hard the weather. And the\n",
      "steadfast goodly Odysseus beheld it and rejoiced, and he\n",
      "laid him in the midst thereof and flung over him the fallen\n",
      "leaves. And as when a man hath hidden away a brand in the\n",
      "black embers at an upland farm, one that hath no neighbours\n",
      "nigh, and so saveth the seed of fire, that he may not have\n",
      "to seek a light otherwhere, even so did Odysseus cover him\n",
      "with the leaves. And Athene shed sleep upon his eyes, that\n",

      "famous seafarer, Dymas, a girl of like age with Nausicaa,\n",
      "who had found grace in her sight. In her shape the\n",
      "grey-eyed Athene spake to the princess, saying:\n",

      "thou thyself must needs go beautifully clad, and have\n",
      "garments to give to them who shall lead thee to the house\n",

      "father betimes in the morning to furnish thee with mules\n",
      "and a wain to carry the men's raiment, and the robes, and\n",
      "the shining coverlets. Yea and for thyself it is seemlier\n",
      "far to go thus than on foot, for the places where we must\n",

      "spinning yarn of sea-purple stain, but her father she met\n",
      "as he was going forth to the renowned kings in their\n",

      "that I may take the goodly raiment to the river to wash, so\n",
      "much as I have lying soiled? Yea and it is seemly that thou\n",

      "shouldest have fresh raiment to wear. Also, there are five\n",
      "dear sons of thine in the halls, two married, but three are\n",

      "garments wherein to go to the dances; for all these things\n",
      "have I taken thought.'\n",
      "\n",

      "harnessed them under the car, while the maiden brought\n",
      "forth from her bower the shining raiment. This she stored\n",
      "in the polished car, and her mother filled a basket with\n",
      "all manner of food to the heart's desire, dainties too she\n",
      "set therein, and she poured wine into a goat-skin bottle,\n",
      "while Nausicaa climbed into the wain. And her mother gave\n",
      "her soft olive oil also in a golden cruse, that she and her\n",
      "maidens might anoint themselves after the bath. Then\n",
      "Nausicaa took the whip and the shining reins, and touched\n",
      "the mules to start them; then there was a clatter of hoofs,\n",
      "and on they strained without flagging, with their load of\n",
      "the raiment and the maiden. Not alone did she go, for her\n",
      "attendants followed with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when they were come to the beautiful stream of the\n",
      "river, where truly were the unfailing cisterns, and bright\n",
      "water welled up free from beneath, and flowed past, enough\n",
      "to wash the foulest garments clean, there the girls\n",
      "unharnessed the mules from under the chariot, and turning\n",
      "them loose they drove them along the banks of the eddying\n",
      "river to graze on the honey-sweet clover. Then they took\n",
      "the garments from the wain, in their hands, and bore them\n",
      "to the black water, and briskly trod them down in the\n",
      "trenches, in busy rivalry. Now when they had washed and\n",
      "cleansed all the stains, they spread all out in order along\n",
      "the shore of the deep, even where the sea, in beating on\n",
      "the coast, washed the pebbles clean. Then having bathed and\n",
      "anointed them well with olive oil, they took their mid-day\n",
      "meal on the river's banks, waiting till the clothes should\n",
      "dry in the brightness of the sun. Anon, when they were\n",
      "satisfied with food, the maidens and the princess, they\n",
      "fell to playing at ball, casting away their tires, and\n",
      "among them Nausicaa of the white arms began the song. And\n",
      "even as Artemis, the archer, moveth down the mountain,\n",
      "either along the ridges of lofty Taygetus or Erymanthus,\n",
      "taking her pastime in the chase of boars and swift deer,\n",

      "But when now she was about going homewards, after yoking\n",

      "Athene turned to other thoughts, that so Odysseus might\n",
      "awake, and see the lovely maiden, who should be his guide\n",
      "to the city of the Phaeacian men. So then the princess\n",
      "threw the ball at one of her company; she missed the girl,\n",
      "and cast the ball into the deep eddying current, whereat\n",
      "they all raised a piercing cry. Then the goodly Odysseus\n",
      "awoke and sat up, pondering in his heart and spirit:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Woe is me! to what men's land am I come now? say, are they\n",
      "froward, and wild, and unjust, or are they hospitable, and\n",
      "of God-fearing mind? How shrill a cry of maidens rings\n",
      "round me, of the nymphs that hold the steep hill-tops, and\n",
      "the river-springs, and the grassy water meadows! It must\n",
      "be, methinks, that I am near men of human speech. Go to, I\n",
      "myself will make trial and see.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith the goodly Odysseus crept out from under the\n",
      "coppice, having broken with his strong hand a leafy bough\n",
      "from the thick wood, to hold athwart his body, that it\n",
      "might hide his nakedness withal. And forth he sallied like\n",
      "a lion mountain-bred, trusting in his strength, who fares\n",
      "out blown and rained upon, with flaming eyes; amid the kine\n",
      "he goes or amid the sheep or in the track of the wild deer;\n",
      "yea, his belly bids him go even to the good homestead to\n",
      "make assay upon the flocks. Even so Odysseus was fain to\n",
      "draw nigh to the fair-tressed maidens, all naked as he was,\n",
      "such need had come upon him. But he was terrible in their\n",
      "eyes, being marred with the salt sea foam, and they fled\n",
      "cowering here and there about the jutting spits of shore.\n",
      "And the daughter of Alcinous alone stood firm, for Athene\n",
      "gave her courage of heart, and took all trembling from her\n",
      "limbs. So she halted and stood over against him, and\n",
      "Odysseus considered whether he should clasp the knees of\n",
      "the lovely maiden, and so make his prayer, or should stand\n",
      "as he was, apart, and beseech her with smooth words, if\n",
      "haply she might show him the town, and give him raiment.\n",
      "And as he thought within himself, it seemed better to stand\n",
      "apart, and beseech her with smooth words, lest the maiden\n",
      "should be angered with him if he touched her knees: so\n",
      "straightway he spake a sweet and cunning word:\n",

      "that path where my sore troubles were to be. Yea, and when\n",

      "never grew there yet so goodly a shoot from ground,--even\n",
      "in such wise as I wonder at thee, lady, and am astonied and\n",
      "do greatly fear to touch thy knees, though grievous sorrow\n",
      "is upon me. Yesterday, on the twentieth day, I escaped from\n",
      "the wine-dark deep, but all that time continually the wave\n",
      "bare me, and the vehement winds drave, from the isle\n",
      "Ogygia. And now some god has cast me on this shore, that\n",
      "here too, methinks, some evil may betide me; for I trow not\n",
      "that trouble will cease; the gods ere that time will yet\n",
      "bring many a thing to pass. But, queen, have pity on me,\n",
      "for after many trials and sore to thee first of all am I\n",
      "come, and of the other folk, who hold this city and land, I\n",
      "know no man. Nay show me the town, give me an old garment\n",
      "to cast about me, if thou hadst, when thou camest here, any\n",
      "wrap for the linen. And may the gods grant thee all thy\n",
      "heart's desire: a husband and a home, and a mind at one\n",
      "with his may they give--a good gift, for there is nothing\n",
      "mightier and nobler than when man and wife are of one heart\n",

      "Then Nausicaa of the white arms answered him, and said:\n",

      "town, and name the name of the people. The Phaeacians hold\n",
      "this city and land, and I am the daughter of Alcinous,\n",
      "great of heart, on whom all the might and force of the\n",
      "Phaeacians depend.'\n",

      "in his wanderings, whom now we must kindly entreat, for all\n",
      "strangers and beggars are from Zeus, and a little gift is\n",
      "dear. So, my maidens, give the stranger meat and drink, and\n",

      "of Alcinous, high of heart. Beside him they laid a mantle,\n",
      "and a doublet for raiment, and gave him soft olive oil in\n",
      "the golden cruse, and bade him wash in the streams of the\n",
      "river. Then goodly Odysseus spake among the maidens,\n",

      "that the unwedded maiden gave him, then Athene, the\n",
      "daughter of Zeus, made him greater and more mighty to\n",
      "behold, and from his head caused deep curling locks to\n",
      "flow, like the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful\n",
      "man overlays gold upon silver--one that Hephaestus and\n",
      "Pallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and full of\n",
      "grace is his handiwork--even so did Athene shed grace about\n",
      "his head and shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then to the shore of the sea went Odysseus apart, and sat\n",
      "down, glowing in beauty and grace, and the princess\n",
      "marvelled at him, and spake among her fair-tressed maidens,\n",
      "saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Listen, my white-armed maidens, and I will say somewhat.\n",
      "Not without the will of all the gods who hold Olympus hath\n",
      "this man come among the godlike Phaeacians. Erewhile he\n",
      "seemed to me uncomely, but now he is like the gods that\n",
      "keep the wide heaven. Would that such an one might be\n",
      "called my husband, dwelling here, and that it might please\n",
      "him here to abide! But come, my maidens, give the stranger\n",
      "meat and drink.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus she spake, and they gave ready ear and hearkened, and\n",
      "set beside Odysseus meat and drink, and the steadfast\n",
      "goodly Odysseus did eat and drink eagerly, for it was long\n",
      "since he had tasted food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Nausicaa of the white arms had another thought. She\n",
      "folded the raiment and stored it in the goodly wain, and\n",
      "yoked the mules strong of hoof, and herself climbed into\n",
      "the car. Then she called on Odysseus, and spake and hailed\n",
      "him: 'Up now, stranger, and rouse thee to go to the city,\n",
      "that I may convey thee to the house of my wise father,\n",
      "where, I promise thee, thou shalt get knowledge of all the\n",
      "noblest of the Phaeacians. But do thou even as I tell thee,\n",
      "and thou seemest a discreet man enough. So long as we are\n",
      "passing along the fields and farms of men, do thou fare\n",
      "quickly with the maidens behind the mules and the chariot,\n",
      "and I will lead the way. But when we set foot within the\n",
      "city,--whereby goes a high wall with towers, and there is a\n",
      "fair haven on either side of the town, and narrow is the\n",
      "entrance, and curved ships are drawn up on either hand of\n",
      "the mole, for all the folk have stations for their vessels,\n",
      "each man one for himself. And there is the place of\n",
      "assembly about the goodly temple of Poseidon, furnished\n",
      "with heavy stones, deep bedded in the earth. There men look\n",
      "to the gear of the black ships, hawsers and sails, and\n",
      "there they fine down the oars. For the Phaeacians care not\n",
      "for bow nor quiver, but for masts, and oars of ships, and\n",
      "gallant barques, wherein rejoicing they cross the grey sea.\n",
      "Their ungracious speech it is that I would avoid, lest some\n",
      "man afterward rebuke me, and there are but too many\n",
      "insolent folk among the people. And some one of the baser\n",
      "sort might meet me and say: \"Who is this that goes with\n",
      "Nausicaa, this tall and goodly stranger? Where found she\n",
      "him? Her husband he will be, her very own. Either she has\n",
      "taken in some shipwrecked wanderer of strange men,--for no\n",
      "men dwell near us; or some god has come in answer to her\n",
      "instant prayer; from heaven has he descended, and will have\n",
      "her to wife for evermore. Better so, if herself she has\n",
      "ranged abroad and found a lord from a strange land, for\n",
      "verily she holds in no regard the Phaeacians here in this\n",
      "country, the many men and noble who are her wooers.\" So\n",
      "will they speak, and this would turn to my reproach. Yea,\n",
      "and I myself would think it blame of another maiden who did\n",
      "such things in despite of her friends, her father and\n",
      "mother being still alive, and was conversant with men\n",
      "before the day of open wedlock. But, stranger, heed well\n",
      "what I say, that as soon as may be thou mayest gain at my\n",
      "father's hands an escort and a safe return. Thou shalt find\n",
      "a fair grove of Athene, a poplar grove near the road, and a\n",
      "spring wells forth therein, and a meadow lies all around.\n",
      "There is my father's demesne, and his fruitful close,\n",
      "within the sound of a man's shout from the city. Sit thee\n",
      "down there and wait until such time as we may have come\n",
      "into the city, and reached the house of my father. But when\n",
      "thou deemest that we are got to the palace, then go up to\n",
      "the city of the Phaeacians, and ask for the house of my\n",
      "father Alcinous, high of heart. It is easily known, and a\n",
      "young child could be thy guide, for nowise like it are\n",
      "builded the houses of the Phaeacians, so goodly is the\n",
      "palace of the hero Alcinous. But when thou art within the\n",
      "shadow of the halls and the court, pass quickly through the\n",
      "great chamber, till thou comest to my mother, who sits at\n",
      "the hearth in the light of the fire, weaving yarn of\n",
      "sea-purple stain, a wonder to behold. Her chair is leaned\n",
      "against a pillar, and her maidens sit behind her. And there\n",
      "my father's throne leans close to hers, wherein he sits and\n",
      "drinks his wine, like an immortal. Pass thou by him, and\n",
      "cast thy hands about my mother's knees, that thou mayest\n",
      "see quickly and with joy the day of thy returning, even if\n",
      "thou art from a very far country. If but her heart be\n",
      "kindly disposed toward thee, then is there hope that thou\n",
      "shalt see thy friends, and come to thy well-builded house,\n",
      "and to thine own country.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She spake, and smote the mules with the shining whip, and\n",
      "quickly they left behind them the streams of the river. And\n",
      "well they trotted and well they paced, and she took heed to\n",
      "drive in such wise that the maidens and Odysseus might\n",
      "follow on foot, and cunningly she plied the lash. Then the\n",
      "sun set, and they came to the famous grove, the sacred\n",
      "place of Athene; so there the goodly Odysseus sat him down.\n",
      "Then straightway he prayed to the daughter of mighty Zeus:\n",
      "'Listen to me, child of Zeus, lord of the aegis, unwearied\n",
      "maiden; hear me even now, since before thou heardest not\n",
      "when I was smitten on the sea, when the renowned\n",
      "Earth-shaker smote me. Grant me to come to the Phaeacians\n",
      "as one dear, and worthy of pity.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him; but she\n",
      "did not yet appear to him face to face, for she had regard\n",

      "Erechtheus. Meanwhile Odysseus went to the famous palace of\n",
      "Alcinous, and his heart was full of many thoughts as he\n",
      "stood there or ever he had reached the threshold of bronze.\n",
      "For there was a gleam as it were of sun or moon through the\n",
      "high-roofed hall of great-hearted Alcinous. Brazen were the\n",
      "walls which ran this way and that from the threshold to the\n",
      "inmost chamber, and round them was a frieze of blue, and\n",
      "golden were the doors that closed in the good house. Silver\n",
      "were the door-posts that were set on the brazen threshold,\n",
      "and silver the lintel thereupon, and the hook of the door\n",
      "was of gold. And on either side stood golden hounds and\n",
      "silver, which Hephaestus wrought by his cunning, to guard\n",
      "the palace of great-hearted Alcinous, being free from death\n",
      "and age all their days. And within were seats arrayed\n",
      "against the wall this way and that, from the threshold even\n",
      "to the inmost chamber, and thereon were spread light\n",
      "coverings finely woven, the handiwork of women. There the\n",
      "Phaeacian chieftains were wont to sit eating and drinking,\n",
      "for they had continual store. Yea, and there were youths\n",
      "fashioned in gold, standing on firm-set bases, with flaming\n",
      "torches in their hands, giving light through the night to\n",
      "the feasters in the palace. And he had fifty handmaids in\n",
      "the house, and some grind the yellow grain on the\n",
      "millstone, and others weave webs and turn the yarn as they\n",
      "sit, restless as the leaves of the tall poplar tree: and\n",
      "the soft olive oil drops off that linen, so closely is it\n",
      "woven. For as the Phaeacian men are skilled beyond all\n",
      "others in driving a swift ship upon the deep, even so are\n",
      "the women the most cunning at the loom, for Athene hath\n",
      "given them notable wisdom in all fair handiwork and cunning\n",
      "wit. And without the courtyard hard by the door is a great\n",
      "garden, off our ploughgates, and a hedge runs round on\n",
      "either side. And there grow tall trees blossoming,\n",
      "pear-trees and pomegranates, and apple-trees with bright\n",
      "fruit, and sweet figs, and olives in their bloom. The fruit\n",
      "of these trees never perisheth neither faileth, winter nor\n",
      "summer, enduring through all the year. Evermore the West\n",
      "Wind blowing brings some fruits to birth and ripens others.\n",
      "Pear upon pear waxes old, and apple on apple, yea and\n",
      "cluster ripens upon cluster of the grape, and fig upon fig.\n",
      "There too hath he a fruitful vineyard planted, whereof the\n",
      "one part is being dried by the heat, a sunny plot on level\n",
      "ground, while other grapes men are gathering, and yet\n",
      "others they are treading in the wine-press. In the foremost\n",
      "row are unripe grapes that cast the blossom, and others\n",
      "there be that are growing black to vintaging. There too,\n",
      "skirting the furthest line, are all manner of garden beds,\n",
      "planted trimly, that are perpetually fresh, and therein are\n",
      "two fountains of water, whereof one scatters his streams\n",
      "all about the garden, and the other runs over against it\n",
      "beneath the threshold of the courtyard, and issues by the\n",
      "lofty house, and thence did the townsfolk draw water. These\n",

      "over the threshold within the house. And he found the\n",
      "captains and the counsellors of the Phaeacians pouring\n",
      "forth wine to the keen-sighted god, the slayer of Argos;\n",
      "for to him they poured the last cup when they were minded\n",
      "to take rest. Now the steadfast goodly Odysseus went\n",
      "through the hall, clad in a thick mist, which Athene shed\n",
      "around him, till he came to Arete and the king Alcinous.\n",
      "And Odysseus cast his hands about the knees of Arete, and\n",
      "then it was that the wondrous mist melted from off him, and\n",
      "a silence fell on them that were within the house at the\n",
      "sight of him, and they marvelled as they beheld him. Then\n",
      "Odysseus began his prayer:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Arete, daughter of god-like Rhexenor, after many toils am\n",
      "I come to thy husband and to thy knees and to these guests,\n",
      "and may the gods vouchsafe them a happy life, and may each\n",
      "one leave to his children after him his substance in his\n",
      "halls and whatever dues of honour the people have rendered\n",
      "unto him. But speed, I pray you, my parting, that I may\n",
      "come the more quickly to mine own country, for already too\n",
      "long do I suffer affliction far from my friends.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith he sat him down by the hearth in the ashes at the\n",
      "fire, and behold, a dead silence fell on all. And at the\n",
      "last the ancient lord Echeneus spake among them, an elder\n",
      "of the Phaeacians, excellent in speech and skilled in much\n",
      "wisdom of old time. With good will he made harangue and\n",
      "spake among them:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Alcinous, this truly is not the more seemly way, nor is it\n",
      "fitting that the stranger should sit upon the ground in the\n",
      "ashes by the hearth, while these men refrain them, waiting\n",
      "thy word. Nay come, bid the stranger arise, and set him on\n",
      "a chair inlaid with silver, and command the henchmen to mix\n",
      "the wine, that we may pour forth likewise before Zeus,\n",
      "whose joy is in the thunder, who attendeth upon reverend\n",
      "suppliants. And let the housewife give supper to the\n",
      "stranger out of such stores as be within.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when the mighty king Alcinous heard this saying, he\n",
      "took Odysseus, the wise and crafty, by the hand, and raised\n",
      "him from the hearth, and set him on a shining chair, whence\n",
      "he bade his son give place, valiant Laodamas, who sat next\n",
      "him and was his dearest. And a handmaid bare water for the\n",
      "hands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured it forth over a\n",
      "silver basin to wash withal, and drew to his side a\n",
      "polished table. And a grave dame bare wheaten bread and set\n",
      "it by him and laid upon the board many dainties, giving\n",
      "freely of such things as she had by her. So the steadfast\n",
      "goodly Odysseus did eat and drink: and then the mighty\n",
      "Alcinous spake unto the henchman:\n",

      "So spake he, and Pontonous mixed the honey-hearted wine,\n",

      "into each cup in turn. But when they had poured forth and\n",
      "had drunken to their heart's content, Alcinous made\n",

      "'Hear me, ye captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians,\n",
      "that I may speak as my spirit bids me. Now that the feast\n",
      "is over, go ye home and lie down to rest; and in the\n",
      "morning we will call yet more elders together, and\n",
      "entertain the stranger in the halls and do fair sacrifice\n",
      "to the gods, and thereafter we will likewise bethink us of\n",
      "the convoy, that so without pain or grief yonder stranger\n",
      "may by our convoy reach his own country speedily and with\n",
      "joy, even though he be from very far away. So shall he\n",
      "suffer no hurt or harm in mid passage, ere he set foot on\n",
      "his own land; but thereafter he shall endure such things as\n",

      "him at his birth when his mother bare him. But if he is\n",
      "some deathless god come down from heaven, then do the gods\n",
      "herein imagine some new device against us. For always\n",
      "heretofore the gods appear manifest amongst us, whensoever\n",
      "we offer glorious hecatombs, and they feast by our side,\n",
      "sitting at the same board; yea, and even if a wayfarer\n",

      "know of human kind the heaviest laden with sorrow, to them\n",
      "might I liken myself in my griefs. Yea, and I might tell of\n",
      "yet other woes, even the long tale of toil that by the\n",
      "gods' will I endured. But as for me, suffer me to sup,\n",
      "afflicted as I am; for nought is there more shameless than\n",

      "content, they went each one to his house to lay them to\n",

      "that the gods of heaven have given me griefs in plenty. But\n",
      "this will I declare to thee, whereof thou dost question and\n",

      "sea; there dwells the daughter of Atlas, crafty Calypso, of\n",
      "the braided tresses, an awful goddess, nor is any either of\n",
      "gods or mortals conversant with her. Howbeit, some god\n",
      "brought me to her hearth, wretched man that I am, all\n",
      "alone, for that Zeus with white bolt crushed my swift ship\n",
      "and cleft it in the midst of the wine-dark deep. There all\n",
      "the rest of my good company was lost, but I clung with fast\n",
      "embrace about the keel of the curved ship, and so was I\n",
      "borne for nine whole days. And on the tenth dark night the\n",
      "gods brought me nigh the isle Ogygia, where Calypso of the\n",
      "braided tresses dwells, an awful goddess. She took me in,\n",
      "and with all care she cherished me and gave me sustenance,\n",
      "and said that she would make me to know not death nor age\n",
      "for all my days; but never did she win my heart within me.\n",
      "There I abode for seven years continually, and watered with\n",
      "my tears the imperishable raiment that Calypso gave me. But\n",
      "when the eighth year came round in his course, then at last\n",
      "she urged and bade me to be gone, by reason of a message\n",
      "from Zeus, or it may be that her own mind was turned. So\n",
      "she sent me forth on a well-bound raft, and gave me\n",
      "plenteous store, bread and sweet wine, and she clad me in\n",
      "imperishable raiment, and sent forth a warm and gentle wind\n",
      "to blow. For ten days and seven I sailed, traversing the\n",
      "deep, and on the eighteenth day the shadowy hills of your\n",
      "land showed in sight, and my heart was glad,--wretched that\n",
      "I was--for surely I was still to be the mate of much\n",
      "sorrow. For Poseidon, shaker of the earth, stirred up the\n",
      "same, who roused against me the winds and stopped my way,\n",
      "and made a wondrous sea to swell, nor did the wave suffer\n",
      "me to be borne upon my raft, as I made ceaseless moan. Thus\n",
      "the storm winds shattered the raft, but as for me I cleft\n",
      "my way through the gulf yonder, till the wind bare and the\n",
      "water brought me nigh your coast. Then as I strove to land\n",
      "upon the shore, the wave had overwhelmed me, dashing me\n",
      "against the great rocks and a desolate place, but at length\n",
      "I gave way and swam back, till I came to the river, where\n",
      "the place seemed best in mine eyes, smooth of rocks, and\n",
      "withal there was a shelter from the wind. And as I came out\n",
      "I sank down, gathering to me my spirit, and immortal night\n",
      "came on. Then I gat me forth and away from the heaven-fed\n",
      "river, and laid me to sleep in the bushes and strewed\n",
      "leaves about me, and the god shed over me infinite sleep.\n",
      "There among the leaves I slept, stricken at heart, all the\n",
      "night long, even till the morning and mid-day. And the sun\n",
      "sank when sweet sleep let me free. And I was aware of the\n",
      "company of thy daughter disporting them upon the sand, and\n",
      "there was she in the midst of them like unto the goddesses.\n",
      "To her I made my supplication, and she showed no lack of a\n",
      "good understanding, behaving so as thou couldst not hope\n",
      "for in chancing upon one so young; for the younger folk\n",
      "lack wisdom always. She gave me bread enough and red wine,\n",

      "to father Zeus, and Athene, and Apollo, would that so\n",
      "goodly a man as thou art, and like-minded with me, thou\n",
      "wouldst wed my daughter, and be called my son, here\n",
      "abiding: so would I give thee house and wealth, if thou\n",
      "wouldst stay of thine own will: but against thy will shall\n",
      "none of the Phaeacians keep thee: never be this\n",
      "well-pleasing in the eyes of father Zeus! And now I ordain\n",
      "an escort for thee on a certain day, that thou mayst surely\n",
      "know, and that day the morrow. Then shalt thou lay thee\n",
      "down overcome by sleep, and they the while shall smite the\n",
      "calm waters, till thou come to thy country and thy house,\n",
      "and whatsoever place is dear to thee, even though it be\n",
      "much farther than Euboea, which certain of our men say is\n",
      "the farthest of lands, they who saw it, when they carried\n",
      "Rhadamanthus, of the fair hair, to visit Tityos, son of\n",
      "Gaia. Even thither they went, and accomplished the journey\n",
      "on the self-same day and won home again, and were not\n",
      "weary. And now shalt thou know for thyself how far my ships\n",

      "salt water with the oar-blade.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus rejoiced;\n",
      "and then he uttered a word in prayer, and called aloud to\n",

      "choose fifty and two noble youths throughout the township,\n",
      "who have been proved heretofore the best. And when ye have\n",
      "made fast the oars upon the benches, step all a shore, and\n",
      "thereafter come to our house, and quickly fall to feasting;\n",
      "and I will make good provision for all. To the noble youths\n",
      "I give this commandment; but ye others, sceptred kings,\n",
      "come to my fair dwelling, that we may entertain the\n",
      "stranger in the halls, and let no man make excuse.\n",
      "Moreover, bid hither the divine minstrel, Demodocus, for\n",

      "He spake and led the way, and the sceptred kings\n",

      "command, to the shore of the unharvested sea. But after\n",
      "they had gone down to the ship and to the sea, first of all\n",
      "they drew the ship down to the deep water, and placed the\n",
      "mast and sails in the black ship, and fixed the oars in\n",
      "leathern loops, all orderly, and spread forth the white\n",
      "sails. And they moored her high out in the shore water, and\n",
      "thereafter went on their way to the great palace of the\n",
      "wise Alcinous. Now the galleries and the courts and the\n",
      "rooms were thronged with men that came to the gathering,\n",

      "sacrificed twelve sheep among them, and eight boars with\n",
      "flashing tusks, and two oxen with trailing feet. These they\n",
      "flayed and made ready, and dressed a goodly feast.\n",

      "sweet song. Then Pontonous, the henchman, set for him a\n",
      "high chair inlaid with silver, in the midst of the guests,\n",
      "leaning it against the tall pillar, and he hung the loud\n",
      "lyre on a pin, close above his head, and showed him how to\n",
      "lay his hands on it. And close by him he placed a basket,\n",
      "and a fair table, and a goblet of wine by his side, to\n",
      "drink when his spirit bade him. So they stretched forth\n",
      "their hands upon the good cheer spread before them. But\n",
      "after they had put from them the desire of meat and drink,\n",
      "the Muse stirred the minstrel to sing the songs of famous\n",

      "Achilles, son of Peleus; how once on a time they contended\n",
      "in fierce words at a rich festival of the gods, but\n",
      "Agamemnon, king of men, was inly glad when the noblest of\n",
      "the Achaeans fell at variance. For so Phoebus Apollo in his\n",

      "what time he crossed the threshold of stone, to seek to the\n",

      "on Trojans and Danaans through the counsel of great Zeus.\n",
      "\n",
      "This song it was that the famous minstrel sang; but\n",
      "Odysseus caught his great purple cloak with his stalwart\n",
      "hands, and drew it down over his head, and hid his comely\n",
      "face, for he was ashamed to shed tears beneath his brows in\n",
      "presence of the Phaeacians. Yea, and oft as the divine\n",
      "minstrel paused in his song, Odysseus would wipe away the\n",
      "tears, and draw the cloak from off his head, and take the\n",
      "two-handled goblet and pour forth before the gods. But\n",
      "whensoever he began again, and the chiefs of the Phaeacians\n",
      "stirred him to sing, in delight at the lay, again would\n",
      "Odysseus cover up his head and make moan. Now none of all\n",
      "the company marked him weeping, but Alcinous alone noted it\n",
      "and was ware thereof as he sat by him and heard him\n",
      "groaning heavily. And presently he spake among the\n",
      "Phaeacians, masters of the oar:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hearken, ye captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians,\n",
      "now have our souls been satisfied with the good feast, and\n",
      "with the lyre, which is the mate of the rich banquet. Let\n",
      "us go forth anon, and make trial of divers games, that the\n",
      "stranger may tell his friends, when home he returneth, how\n",
      "greatly we excel all men in boxing, and wrestling, and\n",
      "leaping, and speed of foot.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He spake, and led the way, and they went with him. And the\n",
      "henchman hung the loud lyre on the pin, and took the hand\n",
      "of Demodocus, and let him forth from the hall, and guided\n",
      "him by the same way, whereby those others, the chiefs of\n",
      "the Phaeacians, had gone to gaze upon the games. So they\n",
      "went on their way to the place of assembly, and with them a\n",
      "great company innumerable; and many a noble youth stood up\n",
      "to play. There rose Acroneus, and Ocyalus, and Elatreus,\n",
      "and Nauteus, and Prymneus, and Anchialus, and Eretmeus, and\n",
      "Ponteus, and Proreus, Thoon, and Anabesineus, and\n",
      "Amphialus, son of Polyneus, son of Tekton, and likewise\n",
      "Euryalus, the peer of murderous Ares, the son of Naubolus,\n",
      "who in face and form was goodliest of all the Phaeacians\n",
      "next to noble Laodamas. And there stood up the three sons\n",
      "of noble Alcinous, Laodamas, and Halius, and god-like\n",
      "Clytoneus. And behold, these all first tried the issue in\n",
      "the foot race. From the very start they strained at utmost\n",
      "speed: and all together they flew forward swiftly, raising\n",
      "the dust along the plain. And noble Clytoneus was far the\n",
      "swiftest of them all in running, and by the length of the\n",
      "furrow that mules cleave in a fallow field, {*} so far did\n",
      "he shoot to the front, and came to the crowd by the lists,\n",
      "while those others were left behind. Then they made trial\n",
      "of strong wrestling, and here in turn Euryalus excelled all\n",
      "the best. And in leaping Amphialus was far the foremost,\n",
      "and Elatreus in weight-throwing, and in boxing Laodamas,\n",
      "the good son of Alcinous. Now when they had all taken their\n",
      "pleasure in the games, Laodamas, son of Alcinous, spake\n",
      "among them:\n",

      "haply thou art practised in any; and thou art like to have\n",
      "knowledge of games, for there is no greater glory for a man\n",

      "is skilled in games, whereof there are many among men,\n",
      "rather art thou such an one as comes and goes in a benched\n",
      "ship, a master of sailors that are merchantmen, one with a\n",
      "memory for his freight, or that hath the charge of a cargo\n",

      "man presumptuous. So true it is that the gods do not give\n",
      "every gracious gift to all, neither shapeliness, nor\n",
      "wisdom, nor skilled speech. For one man is feebler than\n",
      "another in presence, yet the god crowns his words with\n",
      "beauty, and men behold him and rejoice, and his speech runs\n",
      "surely on his way with a sweet modesty, and he shines forth\n",
      "among the gathering of his people, and as he passes through\n",
      "the town men gaze on him as a god. Another again is like\n",
      "the deathless gods for beauty, but his words have no crown\n",
      "of grace about them; even as thou art in comeliness\n",
      "pre-eminent, nor could a god himself fashion thee for the\n",
      "better, but in wit thou art a weakling. Yea, thou hast\n",
      "stirred my spirit in my breast by speaking thus amiss. I am\n",
      "not all unversed in sports, as thy words go, but methinks I\n",
      "was among the foremost while as yet I trusted in my youth\n",
      "and my hands, but now am I holden in misery and pains: for\n",
      "I have endured much in passing through the wars of men and\n",
      "the grievous waves of the sea. Yet even so, for all my\n",
      "affliction, I will essay the games, for thy word hath\n",
      "bitten to the quick, and thou hast roused me with thy\n",
      "saying.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He spake, and clad even as he was in his mantle leaped to\n",
      "his feet, and caught up a weight larger than the rest, a\n",
      "huge weight heavier far than those wherewith the Phaeacians\n",
      "contended in casting. With one whirl he sent it from his\n",
      "stout hand, and the stone flew hurtling: and the\n",
      "Phaeacians, of the long oars, those mariners renowned,\n",
      "crouched to earth beneath the rushing of the stone. Beyond\n",
      "all the marks it flew, so lightly it sped from his hand,\n",
      "and Athene in the fashion of a man marked the place, and\n",
      "spake and hailed him:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yea, even a blind man, stranger, might discern that token\n",
      "if he groped for it, for it is in no wise lost among the\n",
      "throng of the others, but is far the first; for this bout\n",
      "then take heart: not one of the Phaeacians shall attain\n",
      "thereunto or overpass it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake she; and the steadfast goodly Odysseus rejoiced\n",
      "and was glad, for that he saw a true friend in the lists.\n",
      "Then with a lighter heart he spake amid the Phaeacians:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now reach ye this throw, young men, if ye may; and soon,\n",
      "methinks, will I cast another after it, as far or yet\n",
      "further. And whomsoever of the rest his heart and spirit\n",
      "stir thereto, hither let him come and try the issue with\n",
      "me, in boxing or in wrestling or even in the foot race, I\n",
      "care not which, for ye have greatly angered me: let any of\n",
      "all the Phaeacians come save Laodamas alone, for he is mine\n",
      "host: who would strive with one that entreated him kindly?\n",
      "Witless and worthless is the man, whoso challengeth his\n",
      "host that receiveth him in a strange land, he doth but maim\n",
      "his own estate. But for the rest, I refuse none and hold\n",
      "none lightly, but I fain would know and prove them face to\n",
      "face. For I am no weakling in all sports, even in the feats\n",
      "of men. I know well how to handle the polished bow, and\n",
      "ever the first would I be to shoot and smite my man in the\n",
      "press of foes, even though many of my company stood by, and\n",
      "were aiming at the enemy. Alone Philoctetes in the Trojan\n",
      "land surpassed me with the bow in our Achaean archery. But\n",
      "I avow myself far more excellent than all besides, of the\n",
      "mortals that are now upon the earth and live by bread. Yet\n",
      "with the men of old time I would not match me, neither with\n",
      "Heracles nor with Eurytus of Oechalia, who contended even\n",
      "with the deathless gods for the prize of archery. Wherefore\n",
      "the great Eurytus perished all too soon, nor did old age\n",
      "come on him in his halls, for Apollo slew him in his wrath,\n",
      "seeing that he challenged him to shoot a match. And with\n",
      "the spear I can throw further than any other man can shoot\n",
      "an arrow. Only I doubt that in the foot race some of the\n",
      "Phaeacians may outstrip me, for I have been shamefully\n",
      "broken in many waters, seeing that there was no continual\n",
      "sustenance on board; wherefore my knees are loosened.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he and all kept silence; and Alcinous alone\n",
      "answered him, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stranger, forasmuch as these thy words are not ill-taken\n",
      "in our gathering, but thou wouldest fain show forth the\n",
      "valour which keeps thee company, being angry that yonder\n",
      "man stood by thee in the lists, and taunted thee, in such\n",
      "sort as no mortal would speak lightly of thine excellence,\n",
      "who had knowledge of sound words; nay now, mark my speech;\n",
      "so shalt thou have somewhat to tell another hero, when with\n",
      "thy wife and children thou suppest in thy halls, and\n",
      "recallest our prowess, what deeds Zeus bestoweth even upon\n",
      "us from our fathers' days even until now. For we are no\n",
      "perfect boxers, nor wrestlers, but speedy runners, and the\n",
      "best of seamen; and dear to us ever is the banquet, and the\n",
      "harp, and the dance, and changes of raiment, and the warm\n",
      "bath, and love, and sleep. Lo, now arise, ye dancers of the\n",
      "Phaeacians, the best in the land, and make sport, that so\n",
      "the stranger may tell his friends, when he returneth home,\n",
      "how far we surpass all men besides in seamanship, and speed\n",
      "of foot, and in the dance and song. And let one go quickly,\n",
      "and fetch for Demodocus the loud lyre which is lying\n",
      "somewhere in our halls.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake Alcinous the godlike, and the henchman rose to\n",
      "bear the hollow lyre from the king's palace. Then stood up\n",
      "nine chosen men in all, the judges of the people, who were\n",
      "wont to order all things in the lists aright. So they\n",
      "levelled the place for the dance, and made a fair ring and\n",
      "a wide. And the henchman drew near bearing the loud lyre to\n",
      "Demodocus, who gat him into the midst, and round him stood\n",
      "boys in their first bloom, skilled in the dance, and they\n",
      "smote the good floor with their feet. And Odysseus gazed at\n",
      "the twinklings of the feet, and marvelled in spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now as the minstrel touched the lyre, he lifted up his\n",
      "voice in sweet song, and he sang of the love of Ares and\n",
      "Aphrodite, of the fair crown, how at the first they lay\n",
      "together in the house of Hephaestus privily; and Ares gave\n",
      "her many gifts, and dishonoured the marriage bed of the\n",
      "lord Hephaestus. And anon there came to him one to report\n",
      "the thing, even Helios, that had seen them at their\n",
      "pastime. Now when Hephaestus heard the bitter tidings, he\n",
      "went his way to the forge, devising evil in the deep of his\n",
      "heart, and set the great anvil on the stithy, and wrought\n",
      "fetters that none might snap or loosen, that the lovers\n",
      "might there unmoveably remain. Now when he had forged the\n",
      "crafty net in his anger against Ares, he went on his way to\n",
      "the chamber where his marriage bed was set out, and strewed\n",
      "his snares all about the posts of the bed, and many too\n",
      "were hung aloft from the main beam, subtle as spiders'\n",
      "webs, so that none might see them, even of the blessed\n",
      "gods: so cunningly were they forged. Now after he had done\n",
      "winding the snare about the bed, he made as though he would\n",
      "go to Lemnos, that stablished castle, and this was far the\n",
      "dearest of all lands in his sight. But Ares of the golden\n",
      "rein kept no blind watch, what time he saw Hephaestus, the\n",
      "famed craftsman, depart afar. So he went on his way to the\n",
      "house of renowned Hephaestus, eager for the love of crowned\n",
      "Cytherea. Now she was but newly come from her sire, the\n",
      "mighty Cronion, and as it chanced had sat her down; and\n",
      "Ares entered the house, and clasped her hand, and spake,\n",
      "and hailed her:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come, my beloved, let us to bed, and take our pleasure of\n",
      "love, for Hephaestus is no longer among his own people;\n",
      "methinks he is already gone to Lemnos, to the Sintians, men\n",
      "of savage speech.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and a glad thing it seemed to her to lie with\n",
      "him. So they twain went to the couch, and laid them to\n",
      "sleep, and around them clung the cunning bonds of skilled\n",
      "Hephaestus, so that they could not move nor raise a limb.\n",
      "Then at the last they knew it, when there was no way to\n",
      "flee. Now the famous god of the strong arms drew near to\n",
      "them, having turned him back ere he reached the land of\n",
      "Lemnos. For Helios had kept watch, and told him all. So\n",
      "heavy at heart he went his way to his house, and stood at\n",
      "the entering in of the gate, and wild rage gat hold of him,\n",
      "and he cried terribly, and shouted to all the gods:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods, that live for\n",
      "ever, come hither, that ye may see a mirthful thing and a\n",
      "cruel, for that Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, ever\n",
      "dishonours me by reason of my lameness, and sets her heart\n",
      "on Ares the destroyer, because he is fair and straight of\n",
      "limb, but as for me, feeble was I born. Howbeit, there is\n",
      "none to blame but my father and mother,--would they had\n",
      "never begotten me! But now shall ye see where these have\n",
      "gone up into my bed, and sleep together in love; and I am\n",
      "troubled at the sight. Yet, methinks, they will not care to\n",
      "lie thus even for a little while longer, despite their\n",
      "great love. Soon will they have no desire to sleep\n",
      "together, but the snare and the bond shall hold them, till\n",
      "her sire give back to me the gifts of wooing, one and all,\n",
      "those that I bestowed upon him for the hand of his\n",
      "shameless girl; for that his daughter is fair, but without\n",
      "discretion.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he; and lo, the gods gathered together to the\n",
      "house of the brazen floor. Poseidon came, the girdler of\n",
      "the earth, and Hermes came, the bringer of luck, and prince\n",
      "Apollo came, the archer. But the lady goddesses abode each\n",
      "within her house for shame. So the gods, the givers of good\n",
      "things, stood in the porch: and laughter unquenchable arose\n",
      "among the blessed gods, as they beheld the sleight of\n",
      "cunning Hephaestus. And thus would one speak, looking to\n",
      "his neighbour:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ill deed, ill speed! The slow catcheth the swift! Lo, how\n",
      "Hephaestus, slow as he is, hath overtaken Ares, albeit he\n",
      "is the swiftest of the gods that hold Olympus, by his craft\n",
      "hath he taken him despite his lameness; wherefore surely\n",
      "Ares oweth the fine of the adulterer.' Thus they spake one\n",
      "to the other. But the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, spake to\n",
      "Hermes:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hermes, son of Zeus, messenger and giver of good things,\n",
      "wouldst thou be fain, aye, pressed by strong bonds though\n",
      "it might be, to lie on the couch by golden Aphrodite?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the messenger, the slayer of Argos, answered him: 'I\n",
      "would that this might be, Apollo, my prince of archery! So\n",
      "might thrice as many bonds innumerable encompass me about,\n",
      "and all ye gods be looking on and all the goddesses, yet\n",
      "would I lie by golden Aphrodite.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and laughter rose among the deathless gods.\n",
      "Howbeit, Poseidon laughed not, but was instant with\n",
      "Hephaestus, the renowned artificer, to loose the bonds of\n",
      "Ares: and he uttered his voice, and spake to him winged\n",
      "words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Loose him, I pray thee, and I promise even as thou biddest\n",
      "me, that he shall himself pay all fair forfeit in the\n",
      "presence of the deathless gods.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the famous god of the strong arms answered him:\n",
      "'Require not this of me, Poseidon, girdler of the earth.\n",
      "Evil are evil folk's pledges to hold. How could I keep thee\n",
      "bound among the deathless gods, if Ares were to depart,\n",
      "avoiding the debt and the bond?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Poseidon answered him, shaker of the earth:\n",
      "'Hephaestus, even if Ares avoid the debt and flee away, I\n",
      "myself will pay thee all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the famous god of the strong arms answered him: 'It\n",
      "may not be that I should say thee nay, neither is it meet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith the mighty Hephaestus loosed the bonds, and the\n",
      "twain, when they were freed from that strong bond, sprang\n",
      "up straightway, and departed, he to Thrace, but\n",
      "laughter-loving Aphrodite went to Paphos of Cyprus, where\n",
      "is her precinct and fragrant altar. There the Graces bathed\n",
      "and anointed her with oil imperishable, such as is laid\n",
      "upon the everlasting gods. And they clad her in lovely\n",
      "raiment, a wonder to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the song the famous minstrel sang; and Odysseus\n",
      "listened and was glad at heart, and likewise did the\n",
      "Phaeacians, of the long oars, those mariners renowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Alcinous bade Halius and Laodamas dance alone, for\n",
      "none ever contended with them. So when they had taken in\n",
      "their hands the goodly ball of purple hue, that cunning\n",
      "Polybus had wrought for them, the one would bend backwards,\n",
      "and throw it towards the shadowy clouds; and the other\n",
      "would leap upward from the earth, and catch it lightly in\n",
      "his turn, before his feet touched the ground. Now after\n",
      "they had made trial of throwing the ball straight up, the\n",
      "twain set to dance upon the bounteous earth, tossing the\n",
      "ball from hand to hand, and the other youths stood by the\n",
      "lists and beat time, and a great din uprose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it was that goodly Odysseus spake unto Alcinous: 'My\n",
      "lord Alcinous, most notable among all the people, thou\n",
      "didst boast thy dancers to be the best in the world, and\n",
      "lo, thy words are fulfilled; I wonder as I look on them.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and the mighty king Alcinous rejoiced and\n",
      "spake at once among the Phaeacians, masters of the oar:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hearken ye, captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians,\n",
      "this stranger seems to me a wise man enough. Come then, let\n",
      "us give him a stranger's gift, as is meet. Behold, there\n",
      "are twelve glorious princes who rule among this people and\n",
      "bear sway, and I myself am the thirteenth. Now each man\n",
      "among you bring a fresh robe and a doublet, and a talent of\n",
      "fine gold, and let us speedily carry all these gifts\n",
      "together, that the stranger may take them in his hands, and\n",
      "go to supper with a glad heart. As for Euryalus, let him\n",
      "yield amends to the man himself, with soft speech and with\n",
      "a gift, for his was no gentle saying.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and they all assented thereto, and would have\n",
      "it so. And each one sent forth his henchman to fetch his\n",
      "gift, and Euryalus answered the king and spake, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'My lord Alcinous, most notable among all the people, I\n",
      "will make atonement to thy guest according to thy word. I\n",
      "will give him a hanger all of bronze, with a silver hilt\n",
      "thereto, and a sheath of fresh-sawn ivory covers it about,\n",
      "and it shall be to him a thing of price.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith he puts into his hands the hanger dight with\n",
      "silver, and uttering his voice spake to him winged words:\n",
      "'Hail, stranger and father; and if aught grievous hath been\n",
      "spoken, may the storm-winds soon snatch and bear it away.\n",
      "But may the gods grant thee to see thy wife and to come to\n",
      "thine own country, for all too long has thou endured\n",
      "affliction away from thy friends.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: 'Thou\n",
      "too, my friend, all hail; and may the gods vouchsafe thee\n",
      "happiness, and mayst thou never miss this sword which thou\n",
      "hast given me, thou that with soft speech hast yielded me\n",
      "amends.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He spake and hung about his shoulders the silver-studded\n",
      "sword. And the sun sank, and the noble gifts were brought\n",
      "him. Then the proud henchmen bare them to the palace of\n",
      "Alcinous, and the sons of noble Alcinous took the fair\n",
      "gifts, and set them by their reverend mother. And the\n",
      "mighty king Alcinous led the way, and they came in and sat\n",
      "them down on the high seats. And the mighty Alcinous spake\n",
      "unto Arete:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Bring me hither, my lady, a choice coffer, the best thou\n",
      "hast, and thyself place therein a fresh robe and a doublet,\n",
      "and heat for our guest a cauldron on the fire, and warm\n",
      "water, that after the bath the stranger may see all the\n",
      "gifts duly arrayed which the noble Phaeacians bare hither,\n",
      "and that he may have joy in the feast, and in hearing the\n",
      "song of the minstrelsy. Also I will give him a beautiful\n",
      "golden chalice of mine own, that he may be mindful of me\n",
      "all the days of his life when he poureth the drink-offering\n",
      "to Zeus and to the other gods.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and Arete bade her handmaids to set a great\n",
      "cauldron on the fire with what speed they might. And they\n",
      "set the cauldron for the filling of the bath on the blazing\n",
      "fire, and poured water therein, and took faggots and\n",
      "kindled them beneath. So the fire began to circle round the\n",
      "belly of the cauldron, and the water waxed hot. Meanwhile\n",
      "Arete brought forth for her guest the beautiful coffer from\n",
      "the treasure chamber, and bestowed fair gifts therein,\n",
      "raiment and gold, which the Phaeacians gave him. And with\n",
      "her own hands she placed therein a robe and goodly doublet,\n",
      "and uttering her voice spake to him winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do thou now look to the lid, and quickly tie the knot,\n",
      "lest any man spoil thy goods by the way, when presently\n",
      "thou fallest on sweet sleep travelling in thy black ship.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when the steadfast goodly Odysseus heard this saying,\n",
      "forthwith he fixed on the lid, and quickly tied the curious\n",
      "knot, which the lady Circe on a time had taught him. Then\n",
      "straightway the housewife bade him go to the bath and bathe\n",
      "him; and he saw the warm water and was glad, for he was not\n",
      "wont to be so cared for, from the day that he left the\n",
      "house of fair-tressed Calypso, but all that while he had\n",
      "comfort continually as a god.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now after the maids had bathed him and anointed him with\n",
      "olive oil, and had cast a fair mantle and a doublet upon\n",
      "him, he stept forth from the bath, and went to be with the\n",
      "chiefs at their wine. And Nausicaa, dowered with beauty by\n",
      "the gods, stood by the pillar of the well-builded roof, and\n",
      "marvelled at Odysseus, beholding him before her eyes, and\n",
      "she uttered her voice and spake to him winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Farewell, stranger, and even in thine own country bethink\n",
      "thee of me upon a time, for that to me first thou owest the\n",
      "ransom of life.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying:\n",
      "'Nausicaa, daughter of great-hearted Alcinous, yea, may\n",
      "Zeus, the thunderer, the lord of Here, grant me to reach my\n",
      "home and see the day of my returning; so would I, even\n",
      "there, do thee worship as to a god, all my days for\n",
      "evermore, for thou, lady, hast given me my life.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He spake and sat him in the high seat by king Alcinous. And\n",
      "now they were serving out the portions and mixing the wine.\n",
      "Then the henchmen drew nigh leading the sweet minstrel,\n",
      "Demodocus, that was had in honour of the people. So he set\n",
      "him in the midst of the feasters, and made him lean against\n",
      "a tall column. Then to the henchman spake Odysseus of many\n",

      "from them the desire of meat and drink, then Odysseus of\n",
      "many counsels spake to Demodocus, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Demodocus, I praise thee far above all mortal men, whether\n",
      "it be the Muse, the daughter of Zeus, that taught thee, or\n",
      "even Apollo, for right duly dost thou chant the faring of\n",
      "the Achaeans, even all that they wrought and suffered, and\n",
      "all their travail, as if, methinks, thou hadst been\n",
      "present, or heard the tale from another. Come now, change\n",
      "thy strain, and sing of the fashioning of the horse of\n",
      "wood, which Epeius made by the aid of Athene, even the\n",
      "guileful thing, that goodly Odysseus led up into the\n",
      "citadel, when he had laden it with the men who wasted\n",
      "Ilios. If thou wilt indeed rehearse me this aright, so will\n",
      "I be thy witness among all men, how the god of his grace\n",
      "hath given thee the gift of wondrous song.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and the minstrel, being stirred by the god,\n",
      "began and showed forth his minstrelsy. He took up the tale\n",
      "where it tells how the Argives of the one part set fire to\n",
      "their huts, and went aboard their decked ships and sailed\n",
      "away, while those others, the fellowship of renowned\n",
      "Odysseus, were now seated in the assembly-place of the\n",
      "Trojans, all hidden in the horse, for the Trojans\n",
      "themselves had dragged him to the citadel. So the horse\n",
      "stood there, while seated all around him the people spake\n",
      "many things confusedly and three ways their counsel looked;\n",
      "either to cleave the hollow timber with the pitiless spear,\n",
      "or to drag it to the brow of the hill, and hurl it from the\n",
      "rocks, or to leave it as a mighty offering to appease the\n",
      "gods. And on this wise it was to be at the last. For the\n",
      "doom was on them to perish when their city should have\n",
      "closed upon the great horse of wood, wherein sat all the\n",
      "bravest of the Argives, bearing to the Trojans death and\n",
      "destiny. And he sang how the sons of the Achaeans poured\n",
      "forth from the horse, and left the hollow lair, and sacked\n",
      "the burg. And he sang how and where each man wasted the\n",
      "town, and of Odysseus, how he went like Ares to the house\n",
      "of Deiphobus with godlike Menelaus. It was there, he said,\n",
      "that Odysseus adventured the most grievous battle, and in\n",
      "the end prevailed, by grace of great-hearted Athene.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the song that the famous minstrel sang. But the\n",
      "heart of Odysseus melted, and the tear wet his cheeks\n",
      "beneath the eyelids. And as a woman throws herself wailing\n",
      "about her dear lord, who hath fallen before his city and\n",
      "the host, warding from his town and his children the\n",
      "pitiless day; and she beholds him dying and drawing\n",
      "difficult breath, and embracing his body wails aloud, while\n",
      "the foemen behind smite her with spears on back and\n",
      "shoulders and lead her up into bondage, to bear labour and\n",
      "trouble, and with the most pitiful grief her cheeks are\n",
      "wasted; even so pitifully fell the tears beneath the brows\n",
      "of Odysseus. Now none of all the company marked him\n",
      "weeping; but Alcinous alone noted it, and was ware thereof,\n",
      "as he sat nigh him and heard him groaning heavily. And\n",

      "oar:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hearken, ye captains and counsellors of the Phaeacians,\n",
      "and now let Demodocus hold his hand from the loud lyre, for\n",
      "this song of his is nowise pleasing alike to all. From the\n",
      "time that we began to sup, and that the divine minstrel was\n",
      "moved to sing, ever since hath yonder stranger never ceased\n",
      "from woeful lamentation: sore grief, methinks, hath\n",
      "encompassed his heart. Nay, but let the minstrel cease,\n",
      "that we may all alike make merry, hosts and guest, since it\n",
      "is far meeter so. For all these things are ready for the\n",
      "sake of the honourable stranger, even the convoy and the\n",
      "loving gifts which we give him out of our love. In a\n",
      "brother's place stand the stranger and the suppliant, to\n",
      "him whose wits have even a little range, wherefore do thou\n",

      "is the name whereby they called thee at home, even thy\n",

      "dwellers round about? For there is none of all mankind\n",
      "nameless, neither the mean man nor yet the noble, from the\n",
      "first hour of his birth, but parents bestow a name on every\n",
      "man so soon as he is born. Tell me too of thy land, thy\n",
      "township, and thy city, that our ships may conceive of\n",
      "their course to bring thee thither. For the Phaeacians have\n",
      "no pilots nor any rudders after the manner of other ships,\n",
      "but their barques themselves understand the thoughts and\n",
      "intents of men; they know the cities and fat fields of\n",
      "every people, and most swiftly they traverse the gulf of\n",
      "the salt sea, shrouded in mist and cloud, and never do they\n",
      "go in fear of wreck or ruin. Howbeit I heard upon a time\n",
      "this word thus spoken by my father Nausithous, who was wont\n",
      "to say that Poseidon was jealous of us for that we give\n",
      "safe escort to all men. He said that the god would some day\n",
      "smite a well-wrought ship of the Phaeacians as she came\n",
      "home from a convoy over the misty deep, and would\n",
      "overshadow our city with a great mountain. Thus that\n",
      "ancient one would speak, and thus the god may bring it\n",
      "about, or leave it undone, according to the good pleasure\n",
      "of his will. But come now, declare me this and plainly tell\n",
      "it all; whither wast thou borne wandering, and to what\n",
      "shores of men thou camest; tell me of the people and of\n",
      "their fair-lying cities, of those whoso are hard and wild\n",
      "and unjust, and of those likewise who are hospitable and of\n",
      "a god-fearing mind. Declare, too, wherefore thou dost weep\n",
      "and mourn in spirit at the tale of the faring of the Argive\n",
      "Danaans and the lay of Ilios. All this the gods have\n",
      "fashioned, and have woven the skein of death for men, that\n",

      "were he ruled over. Then at once she showed them the\n",
      "high-roofed hall of her father. Now when they had entered\n",
      "the renowned house, they found his wife therein: she was\n",
      "huge of bulk as a mountain peak and was loathly in their\n",
      "sight. Straightway she called the renowned Antiphates, her\n",
      "lord, from the assembly-place, and he contrived a pitiful\n",
      "destruction for my men. Forthwith he clutched up one of my\n",
      "company and made ready his midday meal, but the other twain\n",
      "sprang up and came in flight to the ships. Then he raised\n",
      "the war cry through the town, and the valiant Laestrygons\n",

      "fell in the dust, and his life passed from him. Then I set\n",
      "my foot on him and drew forth the brazen shaft from the\n",
      "wound, and laid it hard by upon the ground and let it lie.\n",
      "Next I broke withies and willow twigs, and wove me a rope a\n",
      "fathom in length, well twisted from end to end, and bound\n",
      "together the feet of the huge beast, and went to the black\n",
      "ship bearing him across my neck, and leaning on a spear,\n",
      "for it was in no wise possible to carry him on my shoulder\n",
      "with the one hand, for he was a mighty quarry. And I threw\n",

      "near to a well of sweet water, and my company went forth\n",
      "from out the ship and deftly got ready supper. But when\n",
      "they had put from them the desire of meat and drink,\n",
      "thereafter they fell a weeping as they thought upon their\n",
      "dear companions whom Scylla had snatched from out the\n",

      "cloud-gatherer roused against them an angry wind with\n",

      "ship, and they went wandering with barbed hooks in quest of\n",
      "game, as needs they must, fishes and fowls, whatsoever\n",
      "might come to their hand, for hunger gnawed at their belly,\n",
      "then at last I departed up the isle, that I might pray to\n",
      "the gods, if perchance some one of them might show me a way\n",
      "of returning. And now when I had avoided my company on my\n",

      "on board the decked ship. Now after they had prayed and cut\n",
      "the throats of the kine and flayed them, they cut out\n",

      "no pure wine to pour over the flaming sacrifices, but they\n",
      "made libation with water and roasted the entrails over the\n",
      "fire. Now after the thighs were quite consumed and they had\n",
      "tasted the inner parts, they cut the rest up small and\n",
      "spitted it on spits. In the same hour deep sleep sped from\n",

      "\n",
      "  Odysseus, sleeping, is set ashore at Ithaca by the\n",
      "  Phaeacians, and waking knows it not. Pallas, in the form of\n",
      "  a shepherd, helps to hide his treasure. The ship that\n",
      "  conveyed him is turned into a rock, and Odysseus by Pallas\n",
      "  is instructed what to do, and transformed into an old\n",
      "  beggarman.\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and dead silence fell on all, and they were\n",
      "spell-bound throughout the shadowy halls. Thereupon\n",
      "Alcinous answered him, and spake, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Odysseus, now that thou hast come to my high house with\n",
      "floor of bronze, never, methinks, shalt thou be driven from\n",
      "thy way ere thou returnest, though thou hast been sore\n",
      "afflicted. And for each man among you, that in these halls\n",
      "of mine drink evermore the dark wine of the elders, and\n",
      "hearken to the minstrel, this is my word and command.\n",
      "Garments for the stranger are already laid up in a polished\n",
      "coffer, with gold curiously wrought, and all other such\n",
      "gifts as the counsellors of the Phaeacians bare hither.\n",
      "Come now, let us each of us give him a great tripod and a\n",
      "cauldron, and we in turn will gather goods among the people\n",
      "and get us recompense; for it were hard that one man should\n",
      "give without repayment.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake Alcinous, and the saying pleased them well. Then\n",
      "they went each one to his house to lay him down to rest;\n",
      "but so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,\n",
      "they hasted to the ship and bare the bronze, the joy of\n",
      "men. And the mighty king Alcinous himself went about the\n",
      "ship and diligently bestowed the gifts beneath the benches,\n",
      "that they might not hinder any of the crew in their rowing,\n",
      "when they laboured at their oars. Then they betook them to\n",
      "the house of Alcinous and fell to feasting. And the mighty\n",
      "king Alcinous sacrificed before them an ox to Zeus, the son\n",
      "of Cronos, that dwells in the dark clouds, who is lord of\n",
      "all. And when they had burnt the pieces of the thighs, they\n",
      "shared the glorious feast and made merry, and among them\n",
      "harped the divine minstrel Demodocus, whom the people\n",
      "honoured. But Odysseus would ever turn his head toward the\n",
      "splendour of the sun, as one fain to hasten his setting:\n",
      "for verily he was most eager to return. And as when a man\n",
      "longs for his supper, for whom all day long two dark oxen\n",
      "drag through the fallow field the jointed plough, yea and\n",
      "welcome to such an one the sunlight sinketh, that so he may\n",
      "get him to supper, for his knees wax faint by the way, even\n",
      "so welcome was the sinking of the sunlight to Odysseus.\n",
      "Then straight he spake among the Phaeacians, masters of the\n",
      "oar, and to Alcinous in chief he made known his word,\n",
      "saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'My lord Alcinous, most notable of all the people, pour ye\n",
      "the drink offering, and send me safe upon my way, and as\n",
      "for you, fare ye well. For now have I all that my heart\n",
      "desired, an escort and loving gifts. May the gods of heaven\n",
      "give me good fortune with them, and may I find my noble\n",
      "wife in my home with my friends unharmed, while ye, for\n",
      "your part, abide here and make glad your wedded wives and\n",
      "children; and may the gods vouchsafe all manner of good,\n",
      "and may no evil come nigh the people!'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and they all consented thereto and bade send\n",
      "the stranger on his way, in that he had spoken aright. Then\n",
      "the mighty Alcinous spake to the henchman: 'Pontonous, mix\n",
      "the bowl and serve out the wine to all in the hall, that we\n",
      "may pray to Father Zeus, and send the stranger on his way\n",
      "to his own country.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and Pontonous mixed the honey-hearted wine,\n",
      "and served it to all in turn. And they poured forth before\n",
      "the blessed gods that keep wide heaven, even there as they\n",
      "sat. Then goodly Odysseus uprose, and placed in Arete's\n",
      "hand the two-handled cup, and uttering his voice spake to\n",
      "her winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Fare thee well, O queen, all the days of thy life, till\n",
      "old age come and death, that visit all mankind. But I go\n",
      "homeward, and do thou in this thy house rejoice in thy\n",
      "children and thy people and Alcinous the king.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith goodly Odysseus stept over the threshold. And\n",
      "with him the mighty Alcinous sent forth a henchman to guide\n",
      "him to the swift ship and the sea-banks. And Arete sent in\n",
      "this train certain maidens of her household, one bearing a\n",
      "fresh robe and a doublet, and another she joined to them to\n",
      "carry the strong coffer, and yet another bare bread and red\n",
      "wine. Now when they had come down to the ship and to the\n",
      "sea, straightway the good men of the escort took these\n",
      "things and laid them by in the hollow ship, even all the\n",
      "meat and drink. Then they strewed for Odysseus a rug and a\n",
      "sheet of linen, on the decks of the hollow ship, in the\n",
      "hinder part thereof, that he might sleep sound. Then he too\n",
      "climbed aboard and laid him down in silence, while they sat\n",
      "upon the benches, every man in order, and unbound the\n",
      "hawser from the pierced stone. So soon as they leant\n",
      "backwards and tossed the sea water with the oar blade, a\n",
      "deep sleep fell upon his eyelids, a sound sleep, very\n",
      "sweet, and next akin to death. And even as on a plain a\n",
      "yoke of four stallions comes springing all together beneath\n",
      "the lash, leaping high and speedily accomplishing the way,\n",
      "so leaped the stern of that ship, and the dark wave of the\n",
      "sounding sea rushed mightily in the wake, and she ran ever\n",
      "surely on her way, nor could a circling hawk keep pace with\n",
      "her, of winged things the swiftest. Even thus she lightly\n",
      "sped and cleft the waves of the sea, bearing a man whose\n",
      "counsel was as the counsel of the gods, one that erewhile\n",
      "had suffered much sorrow of heart, in passing through the\n",
      "wars of men, and the grievous waves; but for that time he\n",
      "slept in peace, forgetful of all that he had suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when the star came up, that is brightest of all, and\n",
      "goes ever heralding the light of early Dawn, even then did\n",
      "the seafaring ship draw nigh the island. There is in the\n",
      "land of Ithaca a certain haven of Phorcys, the ancient one\n",
      "of the sea, and thereby are two headlands of sheer cliff,\n",
      "which slope to the sea on the haven's side and break the\n",
      "mighty wave that ill winds roll without, but within, the\n",
      "decked ships ride unmoored when once they have reached the\n",
      "place of anchorage. Now at the harbour's head is a\n",
      "long-leaved olive tree, and hard by is a pleasant cave and\n",
      "shadowy, sacred to the nymphs, that are called the Naiads.\n",
      "And therein are mixing bowls and jars of stone, and there\n",
      "moreover do bees hive. And there are great looms of stone,\n",
      "whereon the nymphs weave raiment of purple stain, a marvel\n",
      "to behold, and therein are waters welling evermore. Two\n",
      "gates there are to the cave, the one set toward the North\n",
      "Wind whereby men may go down, but the portals toward the\n",
      "South pertain rather to the gods, whereby men may not\n",
      "enter: it is the way of the immortals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thither they, as having knowledge of that place, let drive\n",
      "their ship; and now the vessel in full course ran ashore,\n",
      "half her keel's length high; so well was she sped by the\n",
      "hands of the oarsmen. Then they alighted from the benched\n",
      "ship upon the land, and first they lifted Odysseus from out\n",
      "the hollow ship, all as he was in the sheet of linen and\n",
      "the bright rug, and laid him yet heavy with slumber on the\n",
      "sand. And they took forth the goods which the lordly\n",
      "Phaeacians had given him on his homeward way by grace of\n",
      "the great-hearted Athene. These they set in a heap by the\n",
      "trunk of the olive tree, a little aside from the road, lest\n",
      "some wayfaring man, before Odysseus awakened, should come\n",
      "and spoil them. Then themselves departed homeward again.\n",
      "But the shaker of the earth forgat not the threats,\n",
      "wherewith at the first he had threatened god like Odysseus,\n",
      "and he inquired into the counsel of Zeus, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father Zeus, I for one shall no longer be of worship among\n",
      "the deathless gods, when mortal men hold me in no regard,\n",
      "even Phaeacians, who moreover are of mine own lineage. Lo,\n",
      "now I said that after much affliction Odysseus should come\n",
      "home, for I had no mind to rob him utterly of his return,\n",
      "when once thou hadst promised it and given assent; but\n",
      "behold, in his sleep they have borne him in a swift ship\n",
      "over the sea, and set him down in Ithaca, and given him\n",
      "gifts out of measure, bronze and gold in plenty and woven\n",
      "raiment, much store, such as never would Odysseus have won\n",
      "for himself out of Troy; yea, though he had returned unhurt\n",
      "with the share of the spoil that fell to him.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Zeus, the cloud gatherer, answered him saying: 'Lo,\n",
      "now, shaker of the earth, of widest power, what a word hast\n",
      "thou spoken! The gods nowise dishonour thee; hard would it\n",
      "be to assail with dishonour our eldest and our best. But if\n",
      "any man, giving place to his own hardihood and strength,\n",
      "holds thee not in worship, thou hast always thy revenge for\n",
      "the same, even in the time to come. Do thou as thou wilt,\n",
      "and as seems thee good.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Poseidon, shaker of the earth, answered him:\n",
      "'Straightway would I do even as thou sayest, O god of the\n",
      "dark clouds; but thy wrath I always hold in awe and avoid.\n",
      "Howbeit, now I fain would smite a fair ship of the\n",
      "Phaeacians, as she comes home from a convoy on the misty\n",
      "deep, that thereby they may learn to hold their hands, and\n",
      "cease from giving escort to men; and I would overshadow\n",
      "their city with a great mountain.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Zeus the gatherer of the clouds, answered him, saying:\n",
      "'Friend, learn now what seems best in my sight. At an hour\n",
      "when the folk are all looking forth from the city at the\n",
      "ship upon her way, smite her into a stone hard by the land;\n",
      "a stone in the likeness of a swift ship, that all mankind\n",
      "may marvel, and do thou overshadow their city with a great\n",
      "mountain.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when Poseidon, shaker of the earth, heard this saying,\n",
      "he went on his way to Scheria, where the Phaeacians dwell.\n",
      "There he abode awhile; and lo, she drew near, the seafaring\n",
      "ship, lightly sped upon her way. Then nigh her came the\n",
      "shaker of the earth, and he smote her into a stone, and\n",
      "rooted her far below with the down-stroke of his hand; and\n",
      "he departed thence again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then one to the other they spake winged words, the\n",
      "Phaeacians of the long oars, mariners renowned. And thus\n",
      "would they speak, looking each man to his neighbour:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah me! who is this that fettered our swift ship on the\n",
      "deep as she drave homewards? Even now she stood full in\n",
      "sight.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so they would speak; but they knew not how these\n",
      "things were ordained. And Alcinous made harangue and spake\n",
      "among them:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Lo now, in very truth the ancient oracles of my father\n",
      "have come home to me. He was wont to say that Poseidon was\n",
      "jealous of us, for that we give safe escort to all men. He\n",
      "said that the day would come when the god would smite a\n",
      "fair ship of the Phaeacians, as she came home from a convoy\n",
      "on the misty deep, and overshadow our city with a great\n",
      "mountain. Thus that ancient one would speak; and lo, all\n",
      "these things now have an end. But come, let us all give ear\n",
      "and do according to my word. Cease ye from the convoy of\n",
      "mortals, whensoever any shall come unto our town, and let\n",
      "us sacrifice to Poseidon twelve choice bulls, if perchance\n",
      "he may take pity, neither overshadow our city with a great\n",
      "mountain.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and they were dismayed and got ready the\n",
      "bulls. Thus were they praying to the lord Poseidon, the\n",
      "princes and counsellors of the land of the Phaeacians, as\n",
      "they stood about the altar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even then the goodly Odysseus awoke where he slept on his\n",
      "native land; nor knew he the same again, having now been\n",
      "long afar, for around him the goddess had shed a mist, even\n",
      "Pallas Athene, daughter of Zeus, to the end that she might\n",
      "make him undiscovered for that he was, and might expound to\n",
      "him all things, that so his wife should not know him\n",
      "neither his townsmen and kinsfolk, ere the wooers had paid\n",
      "for all their transgressions. Wherefore each thing showed\n",
      "strange to the lord of the land, the long paths and the\n",
      "sheltering havens and the steep rocks and the trees in\n",
      "their bloom. So he started up, and stood and looked upon\n",
      "his native land, and then he made moan withal, and smote on\n",
      "both his thighs with the down-stroke of his hands, and\n",
      "making lament, he spake, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, woe is me, unto what mortals' land am I now come? Say,\n",
      "are they froward, and wild, and unjust, or hospitable and\n",
      "of a god-fearing mind? Whither do I bear all this treasure?\n",
      "Yea, where am I wandering myself? Oh that the treasure had\n",
      "remained with the Phaeacians where it was, so had I come to\n",
      "some other of the mighty princes, who would have entreated\n",
      "me kindly and sent me on my way. But now I know not where\n",
      "to bestow these things, nor yet will I leave them here\n",
      "behind, lest haply other men make spoil of them. Ah then,\n",
      "they are not wholly wise or just, the princes and\n",
      "counsellors of the Phaeacians, who carried me to a strange\n",
      "land. Verily they promised to bring me to clear-seen\n",
      "Ithaca, but they performed it not. May Zeus requite them,\n",
      "the god of suppliants, seeing that he watches over all men\n",
      "and punishes the transgressor! But come, I will reckon up\n",
      "these goods and look to them, lest the men be gone, and\n",
      "have taken aught away upon their hollow ship.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith he set to number the fair tripods and the\n",
      "cauldrons and the gold and the goodly woven raiment; and of\n",
      "all these he lacked not aught, but he bewailed him for his\n",
      "own country, as he walked downcast by the shore of the\n",
      "sounding sea, and made sore lament. Then Athene came nigh\n",
      "him in the guise of a young man, the herdsman of a flock, a\n",
      "young man most delicate, such as are the sons of kings. And\n",
      "she had a well-wrought mantle that fell in two folds about\n",
      "her shoulders, and beneath her smooth feet she had sandals\n",
      "bound, and a javelin in her hands. And Odysseus rejoiced as\n",
      "he saw her, and came over against her, and uttering his\n",
      "voice spake to her winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friend, since thou art the first that I have chanced on in\n",
      "this land, hail to thee, and with no ill-will mayest thou\n",
      "meet me! Nay, save this my substance and save me too, for\n",
      "to thee as to a god I make prayer, and to thy dear knees\n",
      "have I come. And herein tell me true, that I may surely\n",
      "know. What land, what people is this? what men dwell\n",
      "therein? Surely, methinks, it is some clear seen isle, or a\n",
      "shore of the rich mainland that lies and leans upon the\n",
      "deep.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, spake to him again:\n",
      "'Thou art witless, stranger, or thou art come from afar, if\n",
      "indeed thou askest of this land; nay, it is not so very\n",
      "nameless but that many men know it, both all those who\n",
      "dwell toward the dawning and the sun, and they that abide\n",
      "over against the light toward the shadowy west. Verily it\n",
      "is rough and not fit for the driving of horses, yet is it\n",
      "not a very sorry isle, though narrow withal. For herein is\n",
      "corn past telling, and herein too wine is found, and the\n",
      "rain is on it evermore, and the fresh dew. And it is good\n",
      "for feeding goats and feeding kine; all manner of wood is\n",
      "here, and watering-places unfailing are herein. Wherefore,\n",
      "stranger, the name of Ithaca hath reached even unto\n",
      "Troy-land, which men say is far from this Achaean shore.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake she, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus was glad,\n",
      "and had joy in his own country, according to the word of\n",
      "Pallas Athene, daughter of Zeus, lord of the aegis. And he\n",
      "uttered his voice and spake unto her winged words; yet he\n",
      "did not speak the truth, but took back the word that was on\n",
      "his lips, for quick and crafty was his wit within his\n",
      "breast:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of Ithaca have I heard tell, even in broad Crete, far over\n",
      "the seas; and now have I come hither myself with these my\n",
      "goods. And I left as much again to my children, when I\n",
      "turned outlaw for the slaying of the dear son of Idomeneus,\n",
      "Orsilochus, swift of foot, who in wide Crete was the\n",
      "swiftest of all men that live by bread. Now he would have\n",
      "despoiled me of all that booty of Troy, for the which I had\n",
      "endured pain of heart, in passing through the wars of men,\n",
      "and the grievous waves of the sea, for this cause that I\n",
      "would not do a favour to his father, and make me his squire\n",
      "in the land of the Trojans, but commanded other fellowship\n",
      "of mine own. So I smote him with a bronze-shod spear as he\n",
      "came home from the field, lying in ambush for him by the\n",
      "wayside, with one of my companions. And dark midnight held\n",
      "the heavens, and no man marked us, but privily I took his\n",
      "life away. Now after I had slain him with the sharp spear,\n",
      "straightway I went to a ship and besought the lordly\n",
      "Phoenicians, and gave them spoil to their hearts' desire. I\n",
      "charged them to take me on board, and land me at Pylos or\n",
      "at goodly Elis where the Epeans bear rule. Howbeit of a\n",
      "truth, the might of the wind drave them out of their\n",
      "course, sore against their will, nor did they wilfully play\n",
      "me false. Thence we were driven wandering, and came hither\n",
      "by night. And with much ado we rowed onward into harbour,\n",
      "nor took we any thought of supper, though we stood sore in\n",
      "need thereof, but even as we were we stept ashore and all\n",
      "lay down. Then over me there came sweet slumber in my\n",
      "weariness, but they took forth my goods from the hollow\n",
      "ship, and set them by me where I myself lay upon the sands.\n",
      "Then they went on board, and departed for the fair-lying\n",
      "land of Sidon; while as for me I was left stricken at\n",
      "heart.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he and the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, smiled, and\n",
      "caressed him with her hand; and straightway she changed to\n",
      "the semblance of a woman, fair and tall, and skilled in\n",
      "splendid handiwork. And uttering her voice she spake unto\n",
      "him winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Crafty must he be, and knavish, who would outdo thee in\n",
      "all manner of guile, even if it were a god encountered\n",

      "wast not even in thine own country to cease from thy\n",
      "sleights and knavish words, which thou lovest from the\n",
      "bottom of thine heart! But come, no more let us tell of\n",
      "these things, being both of us practised in deceits, for\n",
      "that thou art of all men far the first in counsel and in\n",
      "discourse, and I in the company of all the gods win renown\n",
      "for my wit and wile. Yet thou knewest not me, Pallas\n",
      "Athene, daughter of Zeus, who am always by thee and guard\n",
      "thee in all adventures. Yea, and I made thee to be beloved\n",
      "of all the Phaeacians. And now am I come hither to contrive\n",
      "a plot with thee and to hide away the goods, that by my\n",
      "counsel and design the noble Phaeacians gave thee on thy\n",
      "homeward way. And I would tell thee how great a measure of\n",
      "trouble thou art ordained to fulfil within thy well-builded\n",
      "house. But do thou harden thy heart, for so it must be, and\n",
      "tell none neither man nor woman of all the folk, that thou\n",

      "much sorrow, submitting thee to the despite of men.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: 'Hard is\n",

      "thee, howsoever wise he be; for thou takest upon thee every\n",
      "shape. But this I know well, that of old thou wast kindly\n",
      "to me, so long as we sons of the Achaeans made war in Troy.\n",
      "But so soon as we had sacked the steep city of Priam and\n",
      "had gone on board our ships, and the god had scattered the\n",

      "heart, till the gods delivered me from my evil case--even\n",
      "till the day when, within the fat land of the men of\n",
      "Phaeacia, thou didst comfort me with thy words, and thyself\n",
      "didst lead me to their city. And now I beseech thee in thy\n",
      "father's name to tell me: for I deem not that I am come to\n",
      "clear-seen Ithaca, but I roam over some other land, and\n",
      "methinks that thou speakest thus to mock me and beguile my\n",

      "thou, so ready of wit and so prudent. Right gladly would\n",

      "angered at the blinding of his dear son. But come, and I\n",
      "will show thee the place of the dwelling of Ithaca, that\n",
      "thou mayst be assured. Lo, here is the haven of Phorcys,\n",
      "the ancient one of the sea, and here at the haven's head is\n",

      "\n",
      "'Ye Naiad nymphs, daughters of Zeus, never did I think to\n",

      "his hand to shield him. But come, old man, do thou tell me\n",
      "of thine own troubles. And herein tell me true, that I may\n",
      "surely know. Who art thou of the sons of men, and whence?\n",
      "Where is thy city, where are they that begat thee? Say on\n",

      "fleet of foot than I. Such an one was I in war, but the\n",
      "labour of the field I never loved, nor home-keeping thrift,\n",
      "that breeds brave children, but galleys with their oars\n",

      "baneful things whereat others use to shudder. But that,\n",
      "methinks, was dear to me which the god put in my heart, for\n",
      "divers men take delight in divers deeds. For ere ever the\n",
      "sons of the Achaeans had set foot on the land of Troy, I\n",
      "had nine times been a leader of men and of swift-faring\n",
      "ships against a strange people, and wealth fell ever to my\n",
      "hands. Of the booty I would choose out for me all that I\n",
      "craved, and much thereafter I won by lot. So my house got\n",
      "increase speedily, and thus I waxed dread and honourable\n",
      "among the Cretans. But when Zeus, of the far-borne voice,\n",
      "devised at the last that hateful path which loosened the\n",
      "knees of many a man in death, then the people called on me\n",
      "and on renowned Idomeneus to lead the ships to Ilios, nor\n",

      "bore hard upon us. There we sons of the Achaeans warred for\n",
      "nine whole years, and then in the tenth year we sacked the\n",
      "city of Priam, and departed homeward with our ships, and a\n",
      "god scattered the Achaeans. But Zeus, the counsellor,\n",
      "devised mischief against me, wretched man that I was! For\n",
      "one month only I abode and had joy in my children and my\n",
      "wedded wife, and all that I had; and thereafter my spirit\n",
      "bade me fit out ships in the best manner and sail to Egypt\n",
      "with my godlike company. Nine ships I fitted out and the\n",
      "host was gathered quickly; and then for six days my dear\n",
      "company feasted, and I gave them many victims that they\n",
      "might sacrifice to the gods and prepare a feast for\n",
      "themselves. But on the seventh day we set sail from wide\n",
      "Crete, with a North Wind fresh and fair, and lightly we ran\n",
      "as it were down stream, yea and no harm came to any ship of\n",
      "mine, but we sat safe and hale, while the wind and the\n",
      "pilots guided the barques. And on the fifth day we came to\n",
      "the fair-flowing Aegyptus, and in the river Aegyptus I\n",
      "stayed my curved ships. Then verily I bade my dear\n",
      "companions to abide there by the ships and to guard them,\n",
      "and I sent forth scouts to range the points of outlook. But\n",
      "my men gave place to wantonness, being the fools of their\n",
      "own force, and soon they fell to wasting the fields of the\n",
      "Egyptians, exceeding fair, and led away their wives and\n",
      "infant children and slew the men. And the cry came quickly\n",
      "to the city, and the people hearing the shout came forth at\n",
      "the breaking of the day, and all the plain was filled with\n",
      "footmen and chariots and with the glitter of bronze. And\n",
      "Zeus, whose joy is in the thunder, sent an evil panic upon\n",
      "my company, and none durst stand and face the foe, for\n",
      "danger encompassed us on every side. There they slew many\n",
      "of us with the edge of the sword, and others they led up\n",
      "with them alive to work for them perforce. But as for me,\n",
      "Zeus himself put a thought into my heart; would to God that\n",
      "I had rather died, and met my fate there in Egypt, for\n",
      "sorrow was still mine host! Straightway I put off my\n",
      "well-wrought helmet from my head, and the shield from off\n",
      "my shoulders, and I cast away my spear from my hand, and I\n",
      "came over against the chariots of the king, and clasped and\n",
      "kissed his knees, and he saved me and delivered me, and\n",
      "setting me on his own chariot took me weeping to his home.\n",
      "Truly many an one made at me with their ashen spears, eager\n",
      "to slay me, for verily they were sore angered. But the king\n",
      "kept them off and had respect unto the wrath of Zeus, the\n",
      "god of strangers, who chiefly hath displeasure at evil\n",
      "deeds. So for seven whole years I abode with their king,\n",
      "and gathered much substance among the Egyptians, for they\n",
      "all gave me gifts. But when the eighth year came in due\n",
      "season, there arrived a Phoenician practised in deceit, a\n",
      "greedy knave, who had already done much mischief among men.\n",
      "He wrought on me with his cunning, and took me with him\n",
      "until he came to Phoenicia, where was his house and where\n",
      "his treasures lay. There I abode with him for the space of\n",
      "a full year. But when now the months and days were\n",
      "fulfilled, as the year came round and the seasons returned,\n",
      "he set me aboard a seafaring ship for Libya, under colour\n",
      "as though I was to convey a cargo thither with him, but his\n",

      "land showed in sight but sky and sea only, even then the\n",
      "son of Cronos stayed a dark cloud over the hollow ship, and\n",
      "the deep grew dark beneath it. And in the same moment Zeus\n",
      "thundered and smote his bolt into the ship, and she reeled\n",
      "all over being stricken by the bolt of Zeus, and was filled\n",
      "with fire and brimstone, and all the crew fell overboard.\n",
      "And like sea-gulls they were borne hither and thither on\n",

      "into my hands the huge mast of the dark-prowed ship, that\n",
      "even yet I might escape from harm. So I clung round the\n",
      "mast and was borne by the ruinous winds. For nine days was\n",
      "I borne, and on the tenth black night the great rolling\n",
      "wave brought me nigh to the land of the Thesprotians. There\n",
      "the king of the Thesprotians, the lord Pheidon, took me in\n",
      "freely, for his dear son lighted on me and raised me by the\n",
      "hand and led me to his house, foredone with toil and the\n",
      "keen air, till he came to his father's palace. And he\n",

      "were to convey him to his own dear country. But ere that,\n",
      "he sent me off, for it chanced that a ship of the\n",
      "Thesprotians was starting for Dulichium, a land rich in\n",
      "grain. Thither he bade them bring me with all diligence to\n",
      "the king Acastus. But an evil counsel concerning me found\n",
      "favour in their sight, that even yet I might reach the\n",
      "extremity of sorrow. When the seafaring ship had sailed a\n",
      "great way from the land, anon they sought how they might\n",
      "compass for me the day of slavery. They stript me of my\n",
      "garments, my mantle and a doublet, and changed my raiment\n",
      "to a vile wrap and doublet, tattered garments, even those\n",
      "thou seest now before thee; and in the evening they reached\n",
      "the fields of clear-seen Ithaca. There in the decked ship\n",
      "they bound me closely with a twisted rope, and themselves\n",
      "went ashore, and hasted to take supper by the sea-banks.\n",
      "Meanwhile the gods themselves lightly unclasped my bands,\n",
      "and muffling my head with the wrap I slid down the smooth\n",
      "lading-plank, and set my breast to the sea and rowed hard\n",
      "with both hands as I swam, and very soon I was out of the\n",
      "water and beyond their reach. Then I went up where there\n",
      "was a thicket, a wood in full leaf, and lay there\n",
      "crouching. And they went hither and thither making great\n",
      "moan; but when now it seemed to them little avail to go\n",
      "further on their quest, they departed back again aboard\n",

      "\n",
      "Then Menelaus, of the loud war cry, answered him:\n",
      "'Telemachus, as for me, I will not hold thee a long time\n",
      "here, that art eager to return; nay, I think it shame even\n",
      "in another host, who loves overmuch or hates overmuch.\n",
      "Measure is best in all things. He does equal wrong who\n",
      "speeds a guest that would fain abide, and stays one who is\n",
      "in haste to be gone. Men should lovingly entreat the\n",
      "present guest and speed the parting. But abide till I bring\n",
      "fair gifts and set them on the car and thine own eyes\n",
      "behold them, and I bid the women to prepare the midday meal\n",
      "in the halls, out of the good store they have within.\n",
      "Honour and glory it is for us, and gain withal for thee,\n",
      "that ye should have eaten well ere ye go on your way, over\n",
      "vast and limitless lands. What and if thou art minded to\n",
      "pass through Hellas and mid Argos? So shall I too go with\n",
      "thee, and yoke thee horses and lead thee to the towns of\n",
      "men, and none shall send us empty away, but will give us\n",
      "some one thing to take with us, either a tripod of goodly\n",
      "bronze or a cauldron, or two mules or a golden chalice.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then wise Telemachus answered him saying: 'Menelaus, son of\n",
      "Atreus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the people, rather\n",
      "would I return even now to mine own land, for I left none\n",
      "behind to watch over my goods when I departed. I would not\n",
      "that I myself should perish on the quest of my godlike\n",
      "father, nor that any good heir-loom should be lost from my\n",
      "halls.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when Menelaus, of the loud war cry, heard this saying,\n",
      "straightway he bade his wife and maids to prepare the\n",
      "midday meal in the halls, out of the good store they had by\n",
      "them. Then Eteoneus, son of Boethous, came nigh him, just\n",
      "risen from his bed, for he abode not far from him. Him\n",
      "Menelaus of the loud war cry bade kindle the fire and roast\n",
      "of the flesh; and he hearkened and obeyed. Then the prince\n",
      "went down into the fragrant treasure chamber, not alone,\n",
      "for Helen went with him, and Megapenthes. Now, when they\n",
      "came to the place where the treasures were stored, then\n",
      "Atrides took a two-handled cup, and bade his son\n",
      "Megapenthes to bear a mixing bowl of silver. And Helen\n",
      "stood by the coffers, wherein were her robes of curious\n",
      "needlework which she herself had wrought. Then Helen, the\n",
      "fair lady, lifted one and brought it out, the widest and\n",
      "most beautifully embroidered of all, and it shone like a\n",
      "star, and lay far beneath the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they went forth through the house till they came to\n",
      "Telemachus; and Menelaus, of the fair hair, spake to him\n",
      "saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Telemachus, may Zeus the thunderer, and the lord of Here,\n",
      "in very truth bring about thy return according to the\n",
      "desire of thy heart. And of the gifts, such as are\n",
      "treasures stored in my house, I will give thee the\n",
      "goodliest and greatest of price. I will give thee a mixing\n",
      "bowl beautifully wrought; it is all of silver and the lips\n",
      "thereof are finished with gold, the work of Hephaestus; and\n",
      "the hero Phaedimus the king of the Sidonians, gave it to me\n",
      "when his house sheltered me, on my coming thither. This cup\n",
      "I would give to thee.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith the hero Atrides set the two-handled cup in his\n",
      "hands. And the strong Megapenthes bare the shining silver\n",
      "bowl and set it before him. And Helen came up, beautiful\n",
      "Helen, with the robe in her hands, and spake and hailed\n",
      "him:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Lo! I too give thee this gift, dear child, a memorial of\n",
      "the hands of Helen, against the day of thy desire, even of\n",
      "thy bridal, for thy bride to wear it. But meanwhile let it\n",
      "lie by thy dear mother in her chamber. And may joy go with\n",
      "thee to thy well-builded house, and thine own country.'\n",
      "\n",
      "With that she put it into his hands, and he took it and was\n",
      "glad. And the hero Peisistratus took the gifts and laid\n",
      "them in the chest of the car, and gazed on all and\n",
      "wondered. Then Menelaus of the fair hair led them to the\n",
      "house. Then they twain sat them down on chairs and high\n",
      "seats, and a handmaid bare water for the hands in a goodly\n",
      "golden ewer, and poured it forth over a silver basin to\n",
      "wash withal, and drew to their side a polished table. And a\n",
      "grave dame bare wheaten bread and set it by them, and laid\n",
      "on the board many dainties, giving freely of such things as\n",
      "she had by her. And the son of Boethous carved by the board\n",
      "and divided the messes, and the son of renowned Menelaus\n",
      "poured forth the wine. So they stretched forth their hands\n",
      "upon the good cheer set before them. Now when they had put\n",
      "from them the desire of meat and drink, then did Telemachus\n",
      "and the glorious son of Nestor yoke the horses and climb\n",
      "into the inlaid car. And they drave forth from the gateway\n",
      "and the echoing gallery. After these Menelaus, of the fair\n",
      "hair, the son of Atreus, went forth bearing in his right\n",
      "hand a golden cup of honey-hearted wine, that they might\n",
      "pour a drink-offering ere they departed. And he stood\n",
      "before the horses and spake his greeting:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Farewell, knightly youths, and salute in my name Nestor,\n",
      "the shepherd of the people; for truly he was gentle to me\n",
      "as a father, while we sons of the Achaeans warred in the\n",
      "land of Troy.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And wise Telemachus answered him, saying: 'Yea verily, O\n",
      "fosterling of Zeus, we will tell him all on our coming even\n",
      "as thou sayest. Would God that when I return to Ithaca I\n",
      "may find Odysseus in his home and tell him all, so surely\n",
      "as now I go on my way having met with all loving-kindness\n",
      "at thy hands, and take with me treasures many and goodly!'\n",
      "\n",
      "And even as he spake a bird flew forth at his right hand,\n",
      "an eagle that bare in his claws a great white goose, a tame\n",
      "fowl from the yard, and men and women followed shouting.\n",
      "But the bird drew near them and flew off to the right,\n",
      "across the horses, and they that saw it were glad, and\n",
      "their hearts were all comforted within them. And\n",
      "Peisistratus, son of Nestor, first spake among them:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Consider, Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the\n",
      "people, whether god hath showed forth this sign for us\n",
      "twain, or for thee thyself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and the warrior Menelaus pondered thereupon,\n",
      "how he should take heed to answer, and interpret it aright.\n",
      "\n",
      "And long-robed Helen took the word and spake, saying: 'Hear\n",
      "me, and I will prophesy as the immortals put it into my\n",
      "heart, and as I deem it will be accomplished. Even as\n",
      "yonder eagle came down from the hill, the place of his\n",
      "birth and kin, and snatched away the goose that was\n",
      "fostered in the house, even so shall Odysseus return home\n",
      "after much trial and long wanderings and take vengeance;\n",
      "yea, or even now is he at home and sowing the seeds of evil\n",
      "for all the wooers.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then wise Telemachus answered her, saying: 'Now may Zeus\n",
      "ordain it so, Zeus the thunderer and the lord of Here. Then\n",
      "would I do thee worship, as to a god, even in my home\n",
      "afar.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He spake and smote the horses with the lash, and they sped\n",
      "quickly towards the plain, in eager course through the\n",
      "city. So all day long they swayed the yoke they bore upon\n",
      "their necks. And the sun sank, and all the ways were\n",
      "darkened. And they came to Pherae, to the house of Diocles,\n",
      "son of Orsilochus, the child begotten of Alpheus. There\n",
      "they rested for the night, and by them he set the\n",
      "entertainment of strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,\n",
      "they yoked the horses and mounted the inlaid car. And forth\n",
      "they drave from the gateway and the echoing gallery. And he\n",
      "touched the horses with the whip to start them, and the\n",
      "pair flew onward nothing loth. And soon thereafter they\n",
      "reached the steep hold of Pylos. Then Telemachus spake unto\n",
      "the son of Nestor, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Son of Nestor, in what wise mightest thou make me a\n",
      "promise and fulfil my bidding? For we claim to be friends\n",
      "by reason of our fathers' friendship from of old. Moreover\n",
      "we are equals in age, and this journey shall turn to our\n",
      "greater love. Take me not hence past my ship, O fosterling\n",
      "of Zeus, but leave me there, lest that old man keep me in\n",
      "his house in my despite, out of his eager kindness, for I\n",
      "must go right quickly home.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and the some of Nestor communed with his own\n",
      "heart how he might make promise, and duly fulfil the same.\n",
      "So as he thought thereon, in this wise it seemed to him\n",
      "best. He turned back his horses toward the swift ship and\n",
      "the sea-banks, and took forth the fair gifts and set them\n",
      "in the hinder part of the ship, the raiment and the gold\n",
      "which Menelaus gave him. And he called to Telemachus and\n",
      "spake to him winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now climb the ship with all haste, and bid all thy company\n",
      "do likewise, ere I reach home and bring the old man word.\n",
      "For well I know in my mind and heart that, being so wilful\n",
      "of heart, he will not let thee go, but he himself will come\n",
      "hither to bid thee to his house, and methinks that he will\n",
      "not go back without thee; for very wroth will he be despite\n",
      "thine excuse.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he spake, and drave the horses with the flowing manes\n",
      "back to the town of the Pylians, and came quickly to the\n",
      "halls. And Telemachus called to his companions and\n",
      "commanded them, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Set ye the gear in order, my friends, in the black ship,\n",
      "and let us climb aboard that we may make way upon our\n",
      "course.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and they gave good heed and hearkened. Then\n",
      "straightway they embarked and sat upon the benches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus was he busy hereat and praying and making\n",
      "burnt-offering to Athene, by the stern of the ship, when\n",
      "there drew nigh him one from a far country, that had slain\n",
      "his man and was fleeing from out of Argos. He was a\n",
      "soothsayer, and by his lineage he came of Melampus, who of\n",
      "old time abode in Pylos, mother of flocks, a rich man and\n",
      "one that had an exceeding goodly house among the Pylians,\n",
      "but afterward he had come to the land of strangers, fleeing\n",
      "from his country and from Neleus, the great-hearted, the\n",
      "proudest of living men, who kept all his goods for a full\n",
      "year by force. All that time Melampus lay bound with hard\n",
      "bonds in the halls of Phylacus, suffering strong pains for\n",
      "the sake of the daughter of Neleus, and for the dread\n",
      "blindness of soul which the goddess, the Erinnys of the\n",
      "dolorous stroke, had laid on him. Howsoever he escaped his\n",
      "fate, and drave away the lowing kine from Phylace to Pylos,\n",
      "and avenged the foul deed upon godlike Neleus, and brought\n",
      "the maiden home to his own brother to wife. As for him, he\n",
      "went to a country of other men, to Argos, the pastureland\n",
      "of horses; for there truly it was ordained that he should\n",
      "dwell, bearing rule over many of the Argives. There he\n",
      "wedded a wife, and builded him a lofty house, and begat\n",
      "Antiphates and Mantius, two mighty sons. Now Antiphates\n",
      "begat Oicles the great-hearted, and Oicles Amphiaraus, the\n",
      "rouser of the host, whom Zeus, lord of the aegis, and\n",
      "Apollo loved with all manner of love. Yet he reached not\n",
      "the threshold of old age, but died in Thebes by reason of a\n",
      "woman's gifts. And the sons born to him were Alcmaeon and\n",
      "Amphilochus. But Mantius begat Polypheides and Cleitus; but\n",
      "it came to pass that the golden-throned Dawn snatched away\n",
      "Cleitus for his very beauty's sake, that he might dwell\n",
      "with the Immortals.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Apollo made the high-souled Polypheides a seer, far the\n",
      "chief of human kind, Amphiaraus being now dead. He removed\n",
      "his dwelling to Hypheresia, being angered with his father,\n",
      "and here he abode and prophesied to all men.\n",
      "\n",
      "This man's son it was, Theoclymenus by name, that now drew\n",
      "nigh and stood by Telemachus. And he found him pouring a\n",
      "drink-offering and praying by the swift black ship, and\n",
      "uttering his voice he spake to him winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friend, since I find thee making burnt-offering in this\n",
      "place, I pray thee, by thine offerings and by the god, and\n",
      "thereafter by thine own head, and in the name of the men of\n",
      "thy company answer my question truly and hide it not. Who\n",
      "art thou of the sons of men and whence? Where is thy city,\n",
      "where are they that begat thee?'\n",
      "\n",
      "And wise Telemachus answered him, saying: 'Yea now,\n",
      "stranger, I will plainly tell thee all. Of Ithaca am I by\n",
      "lineage, and my father is Odysseus, if ever such an one\n",
      "there was, but now hath he perished by an evil fate.\n",
      "Wherefore I have taken my company and a black ship, and\n",
      "have gone forth to hear word of my father that has been\n",
      "long afar.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then godlike Theoclymenus spake to him again: 'Even so I\n",
      "too have fled from my country, for the manslaying of one of\n",
      "mine own kin. And many brethren and kinsmen of the slain\n",
      "are in Argos, the pastureland of horses, and rule mightily\n",
      "over the Achaeans. Wherefore now am I an exile to shun\n",
      "death and black fate at their hands, for it is my doom yet\n",
      "to wander among men. Now set me on board ship, since I\n",
      "supplicate thee in my flight, lest they slay me utterly;\n",
      "for methinks they follow hard after me.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And wise Telemachus answered him, saying: 'Surely I will\n",
      "not drive thee away from our good ship, if thou art fain to\n",
      "come. Follow thou with us then, and in Ithaca thou shalt be\n",
      "welcome to such things as we have.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith he took from him his spear of bronze, and laid it\n",
      "along the deck of the curved ship, and himself too climbed\n",
      "the seafaring ship. Then he sat him down in the stern and\n",
      "made Theoclymenus to sit beside him; and his company loosed\n",
      "the hawsers. Then Telemachus called unto his company, and\n",
      "bade them lay hands on the tackling, and speedily they\n",
      "hearkened to his call. So they raised the mast of pine\n",
      "tree, and set it in the hole of the cross plank and made it\n",
      "fast with forestays, and hauled up the white sails with\n",
      "twisted ropes of ox-hide. And grey-eyed Athene sent them a\n",
      "favouring breeze, rushing violently through the clear sky\n",
      "that the ship might speedily finish her course over the\n",
      "salt water of the sea. So they passed by Crouni and\n",
      "Chalcis, a land of fair streams.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the sun set and all the ways were darkened. And the\n",
      "vessel drew nigh to Pheae, being sped before the breeze of\n",
      "Zeus, and then passed goodly Elis where the Epeans bear\n",
      "rule. From thence he drave on again to the Pointed Isles,\n",
      "pondering whether he should escape death or be cut off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Odysseus and the goodly swineherd were supping in the\n",
      "hut, and the other men sat at meat with them. So when they\n",
      "had put from them the desire of meat and drink, Odysseus\n",
      "spake among them, to prove the swineherd, whether he would\n",
      "still entertain him diligently, and bid him abide there in\n",
      "the steading or send him forward to the city:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Listen now, Eumaeus, and all the others of the company. In\n",
      "the morning I would fain be gone to the town to go a\n",
      "begging, that I be not ruinous to thyself and thy fellows.\n",
      "Now advise me well, and lend me a good guide by the way to\n",
      "lead me thither; and through the city will I wander alone\n",
      "as needs I must, if perchance one may give me a cup of\n",
      "water and a morsel of bread. Moreover I would go to the\n",
      "house of divine Odysseus and bear tidings to the wise\n",
      "Penelope, and consort with the wanton wooers, if haply they\n",
      "might grant me a meal out of the boundless store that they\n",
      "have by them. Lightly might I do good service among them,\n",
      "even all that they would. For lo! I will tell thee and do\n",
      "thou mark and listen. By the favour of Hermes, the\n",
      "messenger, who gives grace and glory to all men's work, no\n",
      "mortal may vie with me in the business of a serving-man, in\n",
      "piling well a fire, in cleaving dry faggots, and in carving\n",

      "wherein meaner men serve their betters.'\n",

      "perishing utterly there, if thou wouldest indeed go into\n",
      "the throng of the wooers, whose outrage and violence\n",
      "reacheth even to the iron heaven! Not such as thou are\n",
      "their servants; they that minister to them are young and\n",
      "gaily clad in mantles and in doublets, and their heads are\n",
      "anointed with oil and they are fair of face, and the\n",
      "polished boards are laden with bread and flesh and wine.\n",
      "Nay, abide here, for none is vexed by thy presence, neither\n",
      "I nor any of my fellows that are with me. But when the dear\n",
      "son of Odysseus comes, he himself will give thee a mantle\n",
      "and a doublet for raiment, and will send thee whithersoever\n",
      "thy heart and spirit bid thee go.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the steadfast goodly Odysseus answered him: 'Oh, that\n",
      "thou mayst so surely be dear to father Zeus as thou art to\n",
      "me, in that thou didst make me to cease from wandering and\n",
      "dread woe! For there is no other thing more mischievous to\n",
      "men than roaming; yet for their cursed belly's need men\n",
      "endure sore distress, to whom come wandering and\n",
      "tribulation and pain. But behold now, since thou stayest me\n",
      "here, and biddest me wait his coming, tell me of the mother\n",

      "and prays evermore to Zeus that his life may waste from out\n",
      "his limbs within his halls. For he has wondrous sorrow for\n",
      "his son that is far away, and for the wedded lady his wise\n",
      "wife, whose death afflicted him in chief and brought him to\n",

      "when we both came to the time of our desire, to the flower\n",
      "of age, thereupon they sent her to Same, and got a great\n",

      "the gods in no wise appear visibly to all. But Odysseus was\n",
      "ware of her and the dogs likewise, which barked not, but\n",
      "with a low whine shrank cowering to the far side of the\n",
      "steading. Then she nodded at him with bent brows, and\n",
      "goodly Odysseus perceived it, and came forth from the room,\n",
      "past the great wall of the yard, and stood before her, and\n",
      "Athene spake to him, saying:\n",

      "declared all that had been enjoined him, he went on his way\n",
      "to the swine and left the enclosure and the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the wooers were troubled and downcast in spirit, and\n",
      "forth they went from the hall past the great wall of the\n",
      "court, and there in front of the gates they held their\n",

      "\n",
      "'Verily, friends, a proud deed hath Telemachus accomplished\n",
      "with a high hand, even this journey, and we said that he\n",
      "should never bring it to pass. But come, launch we a black\n",
      "ship, the best there is, and let us get together oarsmen of\n",
      "the sea, who shall straightway bear word to our friends to\n",
      "return home with speed.'\n",

      "The word was yet on his lips, when Amphinomus turned in his\n",
      "place and saw the ship within the deep harbour, and the men\n",
      "lowering the sails and with the oars in their hands. Then\n",
      "sweetly he laughed out and spake among his fellows:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nay, let us now send no message any more, for lo, they are\n",
      "come home. Either some god has told them all or they\n",
      "themselves have seen the ship of Telemachus go by, and have\n",
      "not been able to catch her.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he spake, and they arose and went to the sea-banks.\n",
      "Swiftly the men drew up the black ship on the shore, and\n",
      "squires, haughty of heart, bare away their weapons. And the\n",
      "wooers all together went to the assembly-place, and\n",
      "suffered none other to sit with them, either of the young\n",
      "men or of the elders. Then Antinous spake among them, the\n",
      "son of Eupeithes:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Lo now, how the gods have delivered this man from his evil\n",
      "case! All day long did scouts sit along the windy\n",
      "headlands, ever in quick succession, and at the going down\n",
      "of the sun we never rested for a night upon the shore, but\n",
      "sailing with our swift ship on the high seas we awaited the\n",
      "bright Dawn, as we lay in wait for Telemachus, that we\n",
      "might take and slay the man himself; but meanwhile some god\n",
      "has brought him home. But even here let us devise an evil\n",
      "end for him, even for Telemachus, and let him not escape\n",
      "out of our hands, for methinks that while he lives we shall\n",
      "never achieve this task of ours. For he himself has\n",
      "understanding in counsel and wisdom, and the people no\n",
      "longer show us favour in all things. Nay come, before he\n",
      "assembles all the Achaeans to the gathering; for methinks\n",
      "that he will in nowise be slack, but will be exceeding\n",
      "wroth, and will stand up and speak out among them all, and\n",
      "tell how we plotted against him sheer destruction but did\n",
      "not overtake him. Then will they not approve us, when they\n",
      "hear these evil deeds. Beware then lest they do us a harm,\n",
      "and drive us forth from our country, and we come to the\n",
      "land of strangers. Nay, but let us be beforehand and take\n",
      "him in the field far from the city, or by the way; and let\n",
      "us ourselves keep his livelihood and his possessions,\n",
      "making fair division among us, but the house we would give\n",
      "to his mother to keep and to whomsoever marries her. But if\n",
      "this saying likes you not, but ye chose rather that he\n",
      "should live and keep the heritage of his father, no longer\n",
      "then let us gather here and eat all his store of pleasant\n",
      "substance, but let each one from his own hall woo her with\n",
      "his bridal gifts and seek to win her; so should she wed the\n",
      "man that gives the most and comes as the chosen of fate.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and they all held their peace. Then Amphinomus\n",
      "made harangue and spake out among them; he was the famous\n",
      "son of Nisus the prince, the son of Aretias, and he led the\n",
      "wooers that came from out Dulichium, a land rich in wheat\n",
      "and in grass, and more than all the rest his words were\n",
      "pleasing to Penelope, for he was of an understanding mind.\n",
      "And now of his good will he made harangue, and spake among\n",
      "them:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friends, I for one would not choose to kill Telemachus; it\n",
      "is a fearful thing to slay one of the stock of kings! Nay,\n",
      "first let us seek to the counsel of the gods, and if the\n",
      "oracles of great Zeus approve, myself I will slay him and\n",
      "bid all the rest to aid. But if the gods are disposed to\n",
      "avert it, I bid you to refrain.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake Amphinomus, and his saying pleased them well. Then\n",
      "straightway they arose and went to the house of Odysseus,\n",
      "and entering in sat down on the polished seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the wise Penelope had a new thought, namely, to show\n",
      "herself to the wooers, so despiteful in their insolence;\n",
      "for she had heard of the death of her son that was to be in\n",
      "the halls, seeing that Medon the henchman had told her of\n",
      "it; who heard their counsels. So she went on her way to the\n",
      "hall, with the women her handmaids. Now when that fair lady\n",
      "had come unto the wooers, she stood by the pillar of the\n",
      "well-builded roof, holding up her glistening tire before\n",
      "her face, and rebuked Antinous and spake and hailed him:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Antinous, full of all insolence, deviser of mischief! and\n",
      "yet they say that in the land of Ithaca thou art chiefest\n",

      "dost thou show thyself. Fool! why indeed dost thou contrive\n",
      "death and doom for Telemachus, and hast no regard unto\n",
      "suppliants who have Zeus to witness? Nay but it is an\n",
      "impious thing to contrive evil one against another. What!\n",
      "knowest thou not of the day when thy father fled to this\n",

      "wroth against him, because he had followed with Taphian sea\n",
      "robbers and harried the Thesprotians, who were at peace\n",
      "with us. So they wished to destroy thy father and wrest\n",
      "from him his dear life, and utterly to devour all his great\n",

      "bathed them and anointed them with olive oil, and cast\n",
      "about them thick mantles and doublets, they came forth from\n",
      "the baths, and sat upon the seats. Then the handmaid bare\n",
      "water for the hands in a goodly golden ewer, and poured it\n",
      "forth over a silver basin to wash withal, and drew to their\n",
      "side a polished table. And the grave dame bare wheaten\n",

      "Argive Helen, for whose sake the Argives and Trojans bore\n",
      "much travail by the gods' designs. Then straightway\n",
      "Menelaus, of the loud war-cry, asked me on what quest I had\n",
      "come to goodly Lacedaemon. And I told him all the truth.\n",
      "Then he made answer, and spake, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"Out upon them, for truly in the bed of a brave-hearted\n",
      "man were they minded to lie, very cravens as they are! Even\n",
      "as when a hind hath couched her newborn fawns unweaned in a\n",
      "strong lion's lair, and searcheth out the mountain-knees\n",
      "and grassy hollows, seeking pasture; and afterward the lion\n",
      "cometh back to his bed, and sendeth forth unsightly death\n",
      "upon that pair, even so shall Odysseus send forth unsightly\n",
      "death upon the wooers. Would to our father Zeus, and\n",
      "Athene, and Apollo, would that in such might as when of old\n",
      "in stablished Lesbos he rose up in strife and wrestled with\n",
      "Philomeleides, and threw him mightily, and all the Achaeans\n",
      "rejoiced; would that in such strength Odysseus might\n",
      "consort with the wooers; then should they all have swift\n",
      "fate and bitter wedlock! But for that whereof thou askest\n",
      "and entreatest me, be sure I will not swerve from the truth\n",
      "in aught that I say, nor deceive thee; but of all that the\n",
      "ancient one of the sea, whose speech is sooth, declared to\n",
      "me, not a word will I hide or keep from thee. He said that\n",

      "halls of the nymph Calypso, who holds him there perforce;\n",
      "so that he may not come to his own country, for he has by\n",
      "him no ships with oars, and no companions to send him on\n",
      "his way over the broad back of the sea.\" So spake Menelaus,\n",
      "son of Atreus, spearsman renowned. Then having fulfilled\n",
      "all, I set out for home, and the deathless gods gave me a\n",
      "fair wind, and brought me swiftly to mine own dear\n",
      "country.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and stirred her heart within her breast. And\n",
      "next the godlike Theoclymenus spake among them:\n",
      "\n",
      "'O wife revered of Odysseus, son of Laertes, verily he hath\n",
      "no clear knowledge; but my word do thou mark, for I will\n",
      "prophesy to thee most truly and hide nought. Now Zeus be\n",
      "witness before any god, and this hospitable board and this\n",
      "hearth of noble Odysseus, whereunto I am come, that\n",
      "Odysseus is even now of a surety in his own country,\n",
      "resting or faring, learning of these evil deeds, and sowing\n",
      "the seeds of evil for all the wooers. So clear was the omen\n",
      "of the bird that I saw as I sat on the decked ship, and I\n",
      "proclaimed it to Telemachus.'\n",

      "in casting of weights and of spears on a levelled place, as\n",
      "heretofore, in their insolence. But when it was now the\n",
      "hour for supper, and the flocks came home from the fields\n",
      "all around, and the men led them whose custom it was, then\n",
      "Medon, who of all the henchmen was most to their mind, and\n",
      "was ever with them at the feast, spake to them, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Noble youths, now that ye have had sport to your hearts'\n",

      "season.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so he spake, and they rose up and departed, and were\n",
      "obedient to his word. Now when they were come into the\n",
      "fair-lying house, they laid aside their mantles on the\n",
      "chairs and high seats, and they sacrificed great sheep and\n",
      "stout goats, yea, and the fatlings of the boars and an\n",
      "heifer of the herd, and got ready the feast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now all this while Odysseus and the goodly swineherd were\n",
      "bestirring them to go from the field to the city; and the\n",
      "swineherd, a master of men, spake first saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, my friend, forasmuch as I see thou art eager to be\n",
      "going to the city to-day, even as my master gave command;--\n",
      "though myself I would well that thou shouldest be left here\n",
      "to keep the steading, but I hold him in reverence and fear,\n",
      "lest he chide me afterwards, and grievous are the rebukes\n",
      "of masters--come then, let us go on our way, for lo, the\n",
      "day is far spent, and soon wilt thou find it colder toward\n",
      "evening.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: 'I\n",
      "mark, I heed: all this thou speakest to one with\n",
      "understanding. But let us be going, and be thou my guide\n",
      "withal to the end. And if thou hast anywhere a staff ready\n",
      "cut, give it me to lean upon, for truly ye said that\n",
      "slippery was the way.'\n",

      "Therewith he cast about his shoulders a mean scrip, all\n",

      "him a staff to his mind. So these twain went on their way,\n",
      "and the dogs and the herdsmen stayed behind to guard the\n",
      "steading. And the swineherd led his lord to the city in the\n",
      "guise of a beggar, a wretched man and an old, leaning on a\n",
      "staff; and sorry was the raiment wherewith he was clothed\n",
      "upon. But as they fared along the rugged path they drew\n",
      "near to the town, and came to the fair flowing spring, with\n",
      "a basin fashioned, whence the people of the city drew\n",
      "water. This well Ithacus and Neritus and Polyctor had\n",
      "builded. And around it was a thicket of alders that grow by\n",
      "the waters, all circlewise, and down the cold stream fell\n",
      "from a rock on high, and above was reared an altar to the\n",
      "Nymphs, whereat all wayfarers made offering. In that place\n",
      "Melanthius, son of Dolius, met them, leading his goats to\n",
      "feast the wooers, the best goats that were in all the\n",
      "herds; and two herdsmen bare him company. Now when he saw\n",
      "them he reviled them, and spake and hailed them, in\n",
      "terrible and evil fashion, and stirred the heart of\n",

      "down on the ashen threshold within the doorway, leaning\n",
      "against a pillar of cypress wood, which the carpenter on a\n",
      "time had deftly planed, and thereon made straight the line.\n",

      "name for riches. But Zeus, the son of Cronos, made me\n",
      "desolate of all,--for surely it was his will,--who sent me\n",
      "with wandering sea-robbers to go to Egypt, a far road, to\n",
      "my ruin. And in the river Aegyptus I stayed my curved\n",
      "ships. Then verily I bade my loved companions to abide\n",
      "there by the ships, and to guard the ship, and I sent forth\n",
      "scouts to range the points of outlook. Now they gave place\n",
      "to wantonness, being the fools of their own force, and soon\n",
      "they fell to wasting the fields of the Egyptians, exceeding\n",
      "fair, and carried away their wives and infant children, and\n",
      "slew the men. And the cry came quickly to the city, and the\n",
      "people heard the shout and came forth at the breaking of\n",
      "the day; and all the plain was filled with footmen and\n",
      "horsemen and with the glitter of bronze. And Zeus, whose\n",
      "joy is in the thunder, sent an evil panic upon my company,\n",
      "and none durst stand and face the foe: for danger\n",
      "encompassed us on every side. There they slew many of us\n",
      "with the edge of the sword, and others they led up with\n",
      "them alive to work for them perforce. But they gave me to a\n",
      "friend who met them, to take to Cyprus, even to Dmetor son\n",

      "firm as a rock, nor reeled he beneath the blow of Antinous,\n",
      "but shook his head in silence, brooding evil in the deep of\n",
      "his heart. Then he went back to the threshold, and sat him\n",
      "there, and laid down his well-filled scrip, and spake among\n",
      "the wooers:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hear me, ye wooers of the renowned queen, and I will say\n",

      "pain nor grief of heart, when a man is smitten in battle\n",
      "fighting for his own possessions, whether cattle or white\n",
      "sheep. But now Antinous hath stricken me for my wretched\n",
      "belly's sake, a thing accursed, that works much ill for\n",
      "men. Ah, if indeed there be gods and Avengers of beggars,\n",
      "may the issues of death come upon Antinous before his\n",

      "to me he came first when he fled from the ship, yet he had\n",
      "not made an end of the tale of his affliction. Even as when\n",
      "a man gazes on a singer, whom the gods have taught to sing\n",
      "words of yearning joy to mortals, and they have a ceaseless\n",
      "desire to hear him, so long as he will sing; even so he\n",
      "charmed me, sitting by me in the halls. He says that he is\n",
      "a friend of Odysseus and of his house, one that dwells in\n",
      "Crete, where is the race of Minos. Thence he has come\n",
      "hither even now, with sorrow by the way, onward and yet\n",
      "onward wandering; and he stands to it that he has heard\n",
      "tidings of Odysseus nigh at hand and yet alive in the fat\n",
      "land of the men of Thesprotia; and he is bringing many\n",
      "treasures to his home.'\n",

      "say somewhat. Here are goats' bellies lying at the fire,\n",

      "Then Antinous chid him, and spake and hailed him:\n",

      "man, and art so terribly afraid; an old man too he is, and\n",
      "foredone with the travail that is come upon him. But I will\n",
      "tell thee plainly, and it shall surely be accomplished. If\n",
      "this man prevail against thee and prove thy master, I will\n",
      "cast thee into a black ship, and send thee to the mainland\n",
      "to Echetus the king, the maimer of all mankind, who will\n",

      "So he spake, and yet greater trembling gat hold of the\n",
      "limbs of Irus, and they led him into the ring, and the\n",

      "such wise that his life should leave his body, even there\n",
      "where he fell, or whether he should strike him lightly, and\n",
      "stretch him on the earth. And as he thought thereon, this\n",
      "seemed to him the better way, to strike lightly, that the\n",
      "Achaeans might not take note of him, who he was. Then the\n",
      "twain put up their hands, and Irus struck at the right\n",
      "shoulder, but the other smote him on his neck beneath the\n",
      "ear, and crushed in the bones, and straightway the red\n",
      "blood gushed up through his mouth, and with a moan he fell\n",
      "in the dust, and drave together his teeth as he kicked the\n",
      "ground. But the proud wooers threw up their hands, and died\n",
      "outright for laughter. Then Odysseus seized him by the\n",
      "foot, and dragged him forth through the doorway, till he\n",
      "came to the courtyard and the gates of the gallery, and he\n",
      "set him down and rested him against the courtyard wall, and\n",
      "put his staff in his hands, and uttering his voice spake to\n",
      "him winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sit thou there now, and scare off swine and dogs, and let\n",
      "not such an one as thou be lord over strangers and beggars,\n",
      "pitiful as thou art, lest haply some worse thing befal\n",
      "thee.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he spake, and cast about his shoulders his mean scrip\n",
      "all tattered, and the cord therewith to hang it, and he gat\n",
      "him back to the threshold, and sat him down there again.\n",
      "Now the wooers went within laughing sweetly, and greeted\n",
      "him, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'May Zeus, stranger, and all the other deathless gods give\n",
      "thee thy dearest wish, even all thy heart's desire, seeing\n",
      "that thou hast made that insatiate one to cease from his\n",
      "begging in the land! Soon will we take him over to the\n",
      "mainland, to Echetus the king, the maimer of all mankind.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So they spake, and goodly Odysseus rejoiced in the omen of\n",
      "the words. And Antinous set by him the great pudding,\n",
      "stuffed with fat and blood, and Amphinomus took up two\n",
      "loaves from the basket, and set them by him and pledged him\n",
      "in a golden cup, and spake saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father and stranger, hail! may happiness be thine in the\n",
      "time to come; but as now, thou art fast holden in many\n",
      "sorrows.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying:\n",
      "'Amphinomus, verily thou seemest to me a prudent man\n",
      "enough; for such too was the father of whom thou art\n",
      "sprung, for I have heard the fair fame of him, how that\n",
      "Nisus of Dulichium was a good man and a rich, and his son\n",
      "they say thou art, and thou seemest a man of understanding.\n",
      "Wherefore I will tell thee, and do thou mark and listen to\n",
      "me. Nought feebler doth the earth nurture than man, of all\n",
      "the creatures that breathe and move upon the face of the\n",
      "earth. Lo, he thinks that he shall never suffer evil in\n",
      "time to come, while the gods give him happiness, and his\n",
      "limbs move lightly. But when again the blessed gods have\n",
      "wrought for him sorrow, even so he bears it, as he must,\n",
      "with a steadfast heart. For the spirit of men upon the\n",
      "earth is even as their day, that comes upon them from the\n",
      "father of gods and men. Yea, and I too once was like to\n",
      "have been prosperous among men, but many an infatuate deed\n",
      "I did, giving place to mine own hardihood and strength, and\n",
      "trusting to my father and my brethren. Wherefore let no man\n",
      "for ever be lawless any more, but keep quietly the gifts of\n",
      "the gods, whatsoever they may give. Such infatuate deeds do\n",
      "I see the wooers devising, as they waste the wealth, and\n",
      "hold in no regard the wife of a man, who, methinks, will\n",
      "not much longer be far from his friends and his own land;\n",
      "nay he is very near. But for thee, may some god withdraw\n",
      "thee hence to thy home, and mayst thou not meet him in the\n",
      "day when he returns to his own dear country! For not\n",
      "without blood, as I deem, will they be sundered, the wooers\n",

      "roof.'\n",

      "Thus he spake, and poured an offering and then drank of the\n",
      "honey-sweet wine, and again set the cup in the hands of the\n",
      "arrayer of the people. But the other went back through the\n",
      "hall, sad at heart and bowing his head; for verily his soul\n",
      "boded evil. Yet even so he avoided not his fate, for Athene\n",
      "had bound him likewise to be slain outright at the hands\n",
      "and by the spear of Telemachus. So he sat down again on the\n",
      "high seat whence he had arisen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, put it into the heart of\n",
      "the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, to show herself to\n",

      "with hope, and that she might win yet more worship from her\n",
      "lord and her son than heretofore. To she laughed an idle\n",
      "laugh, and spake to the nurse, and hailed her, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Eurynome, my heart yearns, though before I had no such\n",
      "desire, to show myself to the wooers, hateful as they are.\n",
      "I would also say a word to my son, that will be for his\n",
      "weal, namely, that he should not for ever consort with the\n",
      "proud wooers, who speak friendly with their lips, but\n",
      "imagine evil in the latter end.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the housewife, Eurynome, spake to her saying: 'Yea my\n",
      "child, all this thou hast spoken as is meet. Go then, and\n",
      "declare thy word to thy son and hide it not, but first wash\n",
      "thee and anoint thy face, and go not as thou art with thy\n",
      "cheeks all stained with tears. Go, for it is little good to\n",
      "sorrow always, and never cease. And lo, thy son is now of\n",
      "an age to hear thee, he whom thou hast above all things\n",
      "prayed the gods that thou mightest see with a beard upon\n",
      "his chin.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then wise Penelope answered her, saying: 'Eurynome, speak\n",
      "not thus comfortably to me, for all thy love, bidding me to\n",
      "wash and be anointed with ointment. For the gods that keep\n",
      "Olympus destroyed my bloom, since the day that he departed\n",
      "in the hollow ships. But bid Autonoe and Hippodameia come\n",
      "to me, to stand by my side in the halls. Alone I will not\n",
      "go among men, for I am ashamed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So she spake, and the old woman passed through the chamber\n",
      "to tell the maidens, and hasten their coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereon the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had another thought.\n",
      "She shed a sweet slumber over the daughter of Icarius, who\n",
      "sank back in sleep, and all her joints were loosened as she\n",
      "lay in the chair, and the fair goddess the while was giving\n",
      "her gifts immortal, that all the Achaeans might marvel at\n",
      "her. Her fair face first she steeped with beauty\n",
      "imperishable, such as that wherewith the crowned Cytherea\n",
      "is anointed, when she goes to the lovely dances of the\n",
      "Graces. And she made her taller and greater to behold, and\n",
      "made her whiter than new-sawn ivory. Now when she had\n",
      "wrought thus, that fair goddess departed, and the\n",
      "white-armed handmaidens came forth from the chamber and\n",
      "drew nigh with a sound of voices. Then sweet sleep left\n",
      "hold of Penelope, and she rubbed her cheeks with her hands,\n",
      "and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Surely soft slumber wrapped me round, most wretched though\n",
      "I be. Oh! that pure Artemis would give me so soft a death\n",
      "even now, that I might no more waste my life in sorrow of\n",
      "heart, and longing for the manifold excellence of my dear\n",
      "lord, for that he was foremost of the Achaeans.'\n",
      "\n",
      "With this word she went down from the shining upper\n",
      "chamber, not alone, for two handmaidens likewise bare her\n",
      "company. But when the fair lady had now come to the wooers,\n",
      "she stood by the pillar of the well-builded roof, holding\n",
      "her glistening tire before her face, and on either side of\n",
      "her stood a faithful handmaid. And straightway the knees of\n",
      "the wooers were loosened, and their hearts were enchanted\n",
      "with love, and each one uttered a prayer that he might be\n",
      "her bed-fellow. But she spake to Telemachus, her dear son:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer stable\n",
      "as they were. While thou wast still a child, thou hadst a\n",
      "yet quicker and more crafty wit, but now that thou art\n",
      "great of growth, and art come to the measure of manhood,\n",
      "and a stranger looking to thy stature and thy beauty might\n",
      "say that thou must be some rich man's son, thy mind and thy\n",
      "thoughts are no longer right as of old. For lo, what manner\n",
      "of deed has been done in these halls, in that thou hast\n",
      "suffered thy guest to be thus shamefully dealt with. How\n",
      "would it be now, if the stranger sitting thus in our house,\n",
      "were to come to some harm all through this evil handling?\n",
      "Shame and disgrace would be thine henceforth among men.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then wise Telemachus answered her: 'Mother mine, as to this\n",
      "matter I count it no blame that thou art angered. Yet have\n",
      "I knowledge and understanding of each thing, of the good\n",
      "and of the evil; but heretofore I was a child. Howbeit I\n",
      "cannot devise all things according to wisdom, for these men\n",
      "in their evil counsel drive me from my wits, on this side\n",
      "and on that, and there is none to aid me. Howsoever this\n",
      "battle between Irus and the stranger did not fall out as\n",
      "the wooers would have had it, but the stranger proved the\n",
      "better man. Would to Father Zeus and Athene and Apollo,\n",
      "that the wooers in our halls were even now thus vanquished,\n",
      "and wagging their heads, some in the court, and some within\n",
      "the house, and that the limbs of each man were loosened in\n",
      "such fashion as Irus yonder sits now, by the courtyard\n",
      "gates wagging his head, like a drunken man, and cannot\n",
      "stand upright on his feet, nor yet get him home to his own\n",
      "place, seeing that his limbs are loosened!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus they spake one to another. But Eurymachus spake to\n",
      "Penelope, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, if all the Achaeans in\n",
      "Iasian Argos could behold thee, even a greater press of\n",
      "wooers would feast in your halls from to-morrow's dawn,\n",
      "since thou dost surpass all women in beauty and stature,\n",
      "and within in wisdom of mind.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then wise Penelope answered him: 'Eurymachus, surely my\n",
      "excellence, both of face and form, the gods destroyed in\n",
      "the day when the Argives embarked for Ilios, and with them\n",
      "went my lord Odysseus. If but he might come and watch over\n",
      "this my life, greater thus would be my fame and fairer! But\n",
      "now am I in sorrow; such a host of ills some god has sent\n",
      "against me. Ah, well do I remember, when he set forth and\n",
      "left his own country, how he took me by the right hand at\n",
      "the wrist and spake, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"Lady, methinks that all the goodly-greaved Achaeans will\n",
      "not win a safe return from Troy; for the Trojans too, they\n",
      "say, are good men at arms, as spearsmen, and bowmen, and\n",
      "drivers of fleet horses, such as ever most swiftly\n",
      "determine the great strife of equal battle. Wherefore I\n",
      "know not if the gods will suffer me to return, or whether I\n",
      "shall be cut off there in Troy; so do thou have a care for\n",
      "all these things. Be mindful of my father and my mother in\n",
      "the halls, even as now thou art, or yet more than now,\n",
      "while I am far away. But when thou seest thy son a bearded\n",
      "man, marry whom thou wilt and leave thine own house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "'Even so did he speak, and now all these things have an\n",
      "end. The night shall come when a hateful marriage shall\n",
      "find me out, me most luckless, whose good hap Zeus has\n",
      "taken away. But furthermore this sore trouble has come on\n",
      "my heart and soul; for this was not the manner of wooers in\n",
      "time past. Whoso wish to woo a good lady and the daughter\n",
      "of a rich man, and vie one with another, themselves bring\n",
      "with them oxen of their own and goodly flocks, a banquet\n",
      "for the friends of the bride, and they give the lady\n",
      "splendid gifts, but do not devour another's livelihood\n",
      "without atonement.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus she spake, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus rejoiced\n",
      "because she drew from them gifts, and beguiled their souls\n",
      "with soothing words, while her heart was set on other\n",
      "things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered her again:\n",
      "'Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, the gifts which any of\n",
      "the Achaeans may choose to bring hither, do thou take; for\n",
      "it were ill to withhold a gift. But we for our part will\n",
      "neither go to our lands nor otherwhere, before thou art\n",
      "wedded to the best man of the Achaeans.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake Antinous, and the saying pleased them well, and\n",
      "each man sent a henchman to bring his gifts. For Antinous\n",
      "his henchman bare a broidered robe, great and very fair,\n",
      "wherein were golden brooches, twelve in all, fitted with\n",
      "well bent clasps. And the henchman straightway bare\n",
      "Eurymachus a golden chain of curious work, strung with\n",
      "amber beads, shining like the sun. And his squires bare for\n",
      "Eurydamas a pair of ear-rings, with three drops well\n",
      "wrought, and much grace shone from them. And out of the\n",
      "house of Peisander the prince, the son of Polyctor, the\n",
      "squire brought a necklet, a very lovely jewel. And likewise\n",
      "the Achaeans brought each one some other beautiful gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the fair lady went aloft to her upper chamber, and her\n",
      "attendant maidens bare for her the lovely gifts, while the\n",
      "wooers turned to dancing and the delight of song, and\n",
      "therein took their pleasure, and awaited the coming of\n",
      "eventide. And dark evening came on them at their pastime.\n",
      "Anon they set up three braziers in the halls, to give them\n",
      "light, and on these they laid firewood all around, faggots\n",
      "seasoned long since and sere, and new split with the axe.\n",
      "And midway by the braziers they placed torches, and the\n",
      "maids of Odysseus, of the hardy heart, held up the lights\n",
      "in turn. Then the prince Odysseus of many counsels himself\n",
      "spake among them saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ye maidens of Odysseus, the lord so long afar, get ye into\n",
      "the chambers where the honoured queen abides, and twist the\n",
      "yarn at her side, and gladden her heart as ye sit in the\n",
      "chamber, or card the wools with your hands; but I will\n",
      "minister light to all these that are here. For even if they\n",
      "are minded to wait the throned Dawn, they shall not outstay\n",
      "me, so long enduring am I.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, but they laughed and looked one at the other.\n",
      "And the fair Melantho chid him shamefully, Melantho that\n",
      "Dolius begat, but Penelope reared, and entreated her\n",
      "tenderly as she had been her own child, and gave her\n",
      "playthings to her heart's desire. Yet, for all that, sorrow\n",
      "for Penelope touched not her heart, but she loved\n",
      "Eurymachus and was his paramour. Now she chid Odysseus with\n",
      "railing words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Wretched guest, surely thou art some brain-struck man,\n",
      "seeing that thou dost not choose to go and sleep at a\n",
      "smithy, or at some place of common resort, but here thou\n",
      "pratest much and boldly among many lords and hast no fear\n",
      "at heart. Verily wine has got about thy wits, or perchance\n",
      "thou art always of this mind, and so thou dost babble idly.\n",
      "Art thou beside thyself for joy, because thou hast beaten\n",
      "the beggar Irus? Take heed lest a better man than Irus rise\n",
      "up presently against thee, to lay his mighty hands about\n",
      "thy head and bedabble thee with blood, and send thee hence\n",
      "from the house.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on her, and\n",
      "said: 'Yea, straight will I go yonder and tell Telemachus\n",
      "hereof, thou shameless thing, for this thy speech, that\n",
      "forthwith he may cut thee limb from limb.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and with his saying scared away the women, who\n",
      "fled through the hall, and the knees of each were loosened\n",
      "for fear, for they deemed that his words were true. But\n",
      "Odysseus took his stand by the burning braziers, tending\n",
      "the lights, and gazed on all the men: but far other matters\n",
      "he pondered in his heart, things not to be unfulfilled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Athene would in no wise suffer the lordly wooers to\n",
      "abstain from biting scorn, that the pain might sink yet the\n",

      "\n",
      "'Hear me ye wooers of the queen renowned, that I may say\n",
      "that which my spirit within me bids me. Not without the\n",

      "shall be assured thee, and there shalt thou gather stones\n",
      "for walls and plant tall trees? There would I provide thee\n",

      "only in evil, thou wilt not care to go to the labours of\n",

      "equal age and force to bear the yoke and of strength\n",
      "untiring! And it should be a field of four ploughgates, and\n",
      "the clod should yield before the ploughshare. Then\n",
      "shouldest thou see me, whether or no I would cut a clean\n",
      "furrow unbroken before me. Or would that this very day\n",
      "Cronion might waken war whence he would, and that I had a\n",
      "shield and two spears, and a helmet all of bronze, close\n",
      "fitting on my temples! Then shouldest thou see me mingling\n",
      "in the forefront of the battle, nor speak and taunt me with\n",
      "this my belly. Nay, thou art exceeding wanton and thy heart\n",
      "is hard, and thou thinkest thyself some great one and\n",
      "mighty, because thou consortest with few men and feeble.\n",
      "Ah, if Odysseus might but return and come to his own\n",

      "Now the goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall,\n",
      "devising with Athene's aid the slaying of the wooers, and\n",

      "Thus he spake, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father,\n",

      "twain sprang up, Odysseus and his renowned son, and set to\n",
      "carry within the helmets and the bossy shields, and the\n",
      "sharp-pointed spears; and before them Pallas Athene bare a\n",
      "golden cresset and cast a most lovely light. Thereon\n",

      "and the fair main-beams of the roof and the cross-beams of\n",
      "pine, and the pillars that run aloft, are bright as it were\n",
      "with flaming fire. Verily some god is within, of those that\n",
      "hold the wide heaven.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Odysseus of many counsels answered him and said: 'Hold\n",
      "thy peace and keep thy thoughts in check and ask not\n",
      "hereof. Lo, this is the wont of the gods that hold Olympus.\n",
      "But do thou go and lay thee down, and I will abide here,\n",

      "of the wooers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now forth from her chamber came the wise Penelope, like\n",

      "thereto a footstool, that was part of the chair, whereon a\n",
      "great fleece was used to be laid. Here then, the wise\n",
      "Penelope sat her down, and next came white-armed handmaids\n",

      "clothed about in sorry raiment, and beg through the land,\n",

      "with thee, for lo, thy fame goes up to the wide heaven, as\n",
      "doth the fame of a blameless king, one that fears the gods\n",
      "and reigns among many men and mighty, maintaining right,\n",
      "and the black earth bears wheat and barley, and the trees\n",

      "do thou ask me now in thy house all else that thou wilt,\n",
      "but inquire not concerning my race and mine own country,\n",
      "lest as I think thereupon thou fill my heart the more with\n",
      "pains, for I am a man of many sorrows. Moreover it beseems\n",
      "me not to sit weeping and wailing in another's house, for\n",
      "it is little good to mourn always without ceasing, lest\n",
      "perchance one of the maidens, or even thyself, be angry\n",
      "with me and say that I swim in tears, as one that is heavy\n",
      "with wine.'\n",

      "Then wise Penelope answered him, and said: 'Stranger,\n",
      "surely my excellence, both of face and form, the gods\n",
      "destroyed, in the day when the Argives embarked for Ilios,\n",
      "and with them went my lord Odysseus. If but he might come\n",
      "and watch over this my life, greater and fairer thus would\n",
      "be my fame! But now am I in sorrow, such a host of ills\n",
      "some god has sent against me. For all the noblest that are\n",

      "suppliants, nor at all of heralds, the craftsmen of the\n",
      "people. But I waste my heart away in longing for Odysseus;\n",
      "so they speed on my marriage and I weave a web of wiles.\n",
      "First some god put it into my heart to set up a great web\n",
      "in the halls, and thereat to weave a robe fine of woof and\n",
      "very wide; and anon I spake among them, saying: \"Ye\n",

      "the hero Laertes, against the day when the ruinous doom\n",
      "shall bring him low, of death that lays men at their\n",
      "length. So shall none of the Achaean women in the land\n",

      "when the fourth year arrived, and the seasons came round as\n",
      "the months waned, and many days were accomplished, then it\n",

      "long as now I am, wandering in sore pain to many cities of\n",

      "and therein are many men innumerable, and ninety cities.\n",

      "waving plumes and goodly Pelasgians. And among these cities\n",
      "is the mighty city Cnosus, wherein Minos when he was nine\n",
      "years old began to rule, he who held converse with great\n",
      "Zeus, and was the father of my father, even of Deucalion,\n",

      "Ilios, with the sons of Atreus; but my famed name is\n",
      "Aethon, being the younger of the twain and he was the first\n",
      "born and the better man. There I saw Odysseus, and gave him\n",
      "guest-gifts, for the might of the wind bare him too to\n",
      "Crete, as he was making for Troy land, and had driven him\n",
      "wandering past Malea. So he stayed his ships in Amnisus,\n",
      "whereby is the cave of Eilithyia, in havens hard to win,\n",
      "and scarce he escaped the tempest. Anon he came up to the\n",
      "city and asked for Idomeneus, saying that he was his friend\n",
      "and held by him in love and honour. But it was now the\n",
      "tenth or the eleventh dawn since Idomeneus had gone in his\n",
      "beaked ships up into Ilios. Then I led him to the house,\n",
      "and gave him good entertainment with all loving-kindness\n",
      "out of the plenty in my house, and for him and for the rest\n",
      "of his company, that went with him, I gathered and gave\n",
      "barley meal and dark wine out of the public store, and oxen\n",
      "to sacrifice to his heart's desire.  There the goodly\n",
      "Achaeans abode twelve days, for the strong North Wind\n",
      "penned them there, and suffered them not to stay upon the\n",

      "even as the snow melts in the high places of the hills, the\n",
      "snow that the South-East wind has thawed, when the West has\n",
      "scattered it abroad, and as it wastes the river streams run\n",
      "full, even so her fair cheeks melted beneath her tears, as\n",
      "she wept her own lord, who even then was sitting by her.\n",
      "Now Odysseus had compassion of heart upon his wife in her\n",
      "lamenting, but his eyes kept steadfast between his eyelids\n",
      "as it were horn or iron, and craftily he hid his tears. But\n",
      "she, when she had taken her fill of tearful lamentation,\n",
      "answered him in turn and spake, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friend as thou art, even now I think to make trial of\n",

      "thither and left my country. Yet even so I will tell thee\n",
      "as I see him in spirit. Goodly Odysseus wore a thick purple\n",
      "mantle, twofold, which had a brooch fashioned in gold, with\n",
      "two sheathes for the pins, and on the face of it was a\n",
      "curious device: a hound in his forepaws held a dappled fawn\n",
      "and gazed on it as it writhed. And all men marvelled at the\n",
      "workmanship, how, wrought as they were in gold, the hound\n",
      "was gazing on the fawn and strangling it, and the fawn was\n",
      "writhing with his feet and striving to flee. Moreover, I\n",
      "marked the shining doublet about his body, like the gleam\n",
      "over the skin of a dried onion, so smooth it was, and\n",
      "glistering as the sun; truly many women looked thereon and\n",
      "wondered. Yet another thing will I tell thee, and do thou\n",
      "ponder it in thy heart. I know not if Odysseus was thus\n",
      "clothed upon at home, or if one of his fellows gave him the\n",
      "raiment as he went on board the swift ship, or even it may\n",
      "be some stranger, seeing that to many men was Odysseus\n",
      "dear, for few of the Achaeans were his peers. I, too, gave\n",
      "him a sword of bronze, and a fair purple mantle with double\n",
      "fold, and a tasseled doublet, and I sent him away with all\n",
      "honour on his decked ship. Moreover, a henchman bare him\n",
      "company, somewhat older than he, and I will tell thee of\n",
      "him too, what manner of man he was. He was\n",
      "round-shouldered, black-skinned, and curly-headed, his name\n",
      "Eurybates; and Odysseus honoured him above all his company,\n",
      "because in all things he was like-minded with himself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and in her heart he stirred yet more the\n",
      "desire of weeping, as she knew the certain tokens that\n",
      "Odysseus showed her. So when she had taken her fill of\n",
      "tearful lament, then she answered him, and spake saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now verily, stranger, thou that even before wert held in\n",
      "pity, shalt be dear and honourable in my halls, for it was\n",
      "I who gave him these garments, as judging from thy words,\n",
      "and folded them myself, and brought them from the chamber,\n",
      "and added besides the shining brooch to be his jewel. But\n",
      "him I shall never welcome back, returned home to his own\n",

      "way from the isle Thrinacia: for Zeus and Helios had a\n",
      "grudge against him, because his company had slain the kine\n",
      "of Helios. They for their part all perished in the wash of\n",
      "the sea, but the wave cast him on the keel of the ship out\n",
      "upon the coast, on the land of the Phaeacians that are near\n",

      "unto a god, and gave him many gifts, and themselves would\n",
      "fain have sent him scathless home. Yea and Odysseus would\n",
      "have been here long since, but he thought it more\n",
      "profitable to gather wealth, as he journeyed over wide\n",

      "all men upon earth, nor may any mortal men contend with\n",
      "him. So Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me. Moreover\n",

      "Forasmuch as I am come hither in wrath against many a one,\n",
      "both man and woman, over the fruitful earth, wherefore let\n",
      "the child's name be \"a man of wrath,\" Odysseus. But when\n",
      "the child reaches his full growth, and comes to the great\n",
      "house of his mother's kin at Parnassus, whereby are my\n",
      "possessions, I will give him a gift out of these and send\n",
      "him on his way rejoicing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore it was that Odysseus went to receive the splendid\n",
      "gifts. And Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus grasped his\n",
      "hands and greeted him with gentle words, and Amphithea, his\n",
      "mother's mother, clasped him in her arms and kissed his\n",
      "face and both his fair eyes. Then Autolycus called to his\n",
      "renowned sons to get ready the meal, and they hearkened to\n",
      "the call. So presently they led in a five-year-old bull,\n",
      "which they flayed and busily prepared, and cut up all the\n",
      "limbs and deftly chopped them small, and pierced them with\n",
      "spits and roasted them cunningly, dividing the messes. So\n",
      "for that livelong day they feasted till the going down of\n",
      "the sun, and their soul lacked not ought of the equal\n",
      "banquet. But when the sun sank and darkness came on, they\n",
      "laid them to rest and took the boon of sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now so soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered,\n",
      "they all went forth to the chase, the hounds and the sons\n",
      "of Autolycus, and with them went the goodly Odysseus. So\n",
      "they fared up the steep hill of wood-clad Parnassus, and\n",
      "quickly they came to the windy hollows. Now the sun was but\n",
      "just striking on the fields, and was come forth from the\n",
      "soft flowing stream of deep Oceanus. Then the beaters\n",
      "reached a glade of the woodland, and before them went the\n",
      "hounds tracking a scent, but behind came the sons of\n",
      "Autolycus, and among them goodly Odysseus followed close on\n",
      "the hounds, swaying a long spear. Thereby in a thick lair\n",
      "was a great boar lying, and through the coppice the force\n",
      "of the wet winds blew never, neither did the bright sun\n",
      "light on it with his rays, nor could the rain pierce\n",
      "through, so thick it was, and of fallen leaves there was\n",
      "great plenty therein. Then the tramp of the men's feet and\n",
      "of the dogs' came upon the boar, as they pressed on in the\n",
      "chase, and forth from his lair he sprang towards them with\n",
      "crest well bristled and fire shining in his eyes, and stood\n",
      "at bay before them all. Then Odysseus was the first to rush\n",
      "in, holding his spear aloft in his strong hand, most eager\n",
      "to stab him; but the boar was too quick and drave a gash\n",
      "above the knee, ripping deep into the flesh with his tusk\n",
      "as he charged sideways, but he reached not to the bone of\n",
      "the man. Then Odysseus aimed well and smote him on his\n",
      "right shoulder, so that the point of the bright spear went\n",
      "clean through, and the boar fell in the dust with a cry,\n",
      "and his life passed from him. Then the dear sons of\n",
      "Autolycus began to busy them with the carcase, and as for\n",
      "the wound of the noble godlike Odysseus, they bound it up\n",
      "skilfully, and stayed the black blood with a song of\n",
      "healing, and straight-way returned to the house of their\n",
      "dear father. Then Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus got\n",
      "him well healed of his hurt, and gave him splendid gifts,\n",
      "and quickly sent him with all love to Ithaca, gladly\n",
      "speeding a glad guest. There his father and lady mother\n",
      "were glad of his returning, and asked him of all his\n",
      "adventures, and of his wound how he came by it, and duly he\n",
      "told them all, namely how the boar gashed him with his\n",
      "white tusk in the chase, when he had gone to Parnassus with\n",
      "the sons of Autolycus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the old woman took the scarred limb and passed her\n",
      "hands down it, and knew it by the touch and let the foot\n",
      "drop suddenly, so that the knee fell into the bath, and the\n",
      "brazen vessel rang, being turned over on the other side,\n",
      "and behold, the water was spilled on the ground. Then joy\n",
      "and anguish came on her in one moment, and both her eyes\n",
      "filled up with tears, and the voice of her utterance was\n",
      "stayed, and touching the chin of Odysseus she spake to him,\n",
      "saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yea verily, thou art Odysseus, my dear child, and I knew\n",
      "thee not before, till I had handled all the body of my\n",
      "lord.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewithal she looked towards Penelope, as minded to make\n",
      "a sign that her husband was now home. But Penelope could\n",
      "not meet her eyes nor take note of her, for Athene had bent\n",
      "her thoughts to other things. But Odysseus feeling for the\n",
      "old woman's throat gript it with his right hand and with\n",
      "the other drew her closer to him and spake, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Woman, why wouldest thou indeed destroy me? It was thou\n",
      "that didst nurse me there at thine own breast, and now\n",
      "after travail and much pain I am come in the twentieth year\n",
      "to mine own country. But since thou art ware of me, and the\n",
      "god has put this in thy heart, be silent, lest another\n",
      "learn the matter in the halls. For on this wise I will\n",
      "declare it, and it shall surely be accomplished:--if the\n",
      "gods subdue the lordly wooers unto me, I will not hold my\n",
      "hand from thee, my nurse though thou art, when I slay the\n",
      "other handmaids in my halls.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then wise Eurycleia answered, saying: 'My child, what word\n",
      "hath escaped the door of thy lips? Thou knowest how firm is\n",
      "my spirit and unyielding, and I will keep me fast as\n",
      "stubborn stone or iron. Yet another thing will I tell thee,\n",
      "and do thou ponder it in thine heart. If the gods subdue\n",
      "the lordly wooers to thy hand, then will I tell thee all\n",
      "the tale of the women in the halls, which of them dishonour\n",
      "thee and which be guiltless.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: 'Nurse,\n",
      "wherefore I pray thee wilt thou speak of these? Thou\n",
      "needest not, for even I myself will mark them well and take\n",
      "knowledge of each. Nay, do thou keep thy saying to thyself,\n",
      "and leave the rest to the gods.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so he spake, and the old woman passed forth from the\n",
      "hall to bring water for his feet, for that first water was\n",
      "all spilled. So when she had washed him and anointed him\n",
      "well with olive-oil, Odysseus again drew up his settle\n",
      "nearer to the fire to warm himself, and covered up the scar\n",
      "with his rags. Then the wise Penelope spake first, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stranger, there is yet a little thing I will make bold to\n",
      "ask thee, for soon will it be the hour for pleasant rest,\n",
      "for him on whomsoever sweet sleep falls, though he be heavy\n",
      "with care. But to me has the god given sorrow, yea sorrow\n",
      "measureless, for all the day I have my fill of wailing and\n",
      "lamenting, as I look to mine own housewiferies and to the\n",
      "tasks of the maidens in the house. But when night comes and\n",
      "sleep takes hold of all, I lie on my couch, and shrewd\n",
      "cares, thick thronging about my inmost heart, disquiet me\n",
      "in my sorrowing. Even as when the daughter of Pandareus,\n",
      "the nightingale of the greenwood, sings sweet in the first\n",
      "season of the spring, from her place in the thick leafage\n",
      "of the trees, and with many a turn and trill she pours\n",
      "forth her full-voiced music bewailing her child, dear\n",
      "Itylus, whom on a time she slew with the sword unwitting,\n",
      "Itylus the son of Zethus the prince; even as her song, my\n",
      "troubled soul sways to and fro. Shall I abide with my son,\n",
      "and keep all secure, all the things of my getting, my\n",
      "thralls and great high-roofed home, having respect unto the\n",
      "bed of my lord and the voice of the people, or even now\n",
      "follow with the best of the Achaeans that woos me in the\n",
      "halls, and gives a bride-price beyond reckoning? Now my\n",
      "son, so long as he was a child and light of heart, suffered\n",
      "me not to marry and leave the house of my husband; but now\n",
      "that he is great of growth, and is come to the full measure\n",
      "of manhood, lo now he prays me to go back home from these\n",
      "walls, being vexed for his possessions that the Achaeans\n",
      "devour before his eyes. But come now, hear a dream of mine\n",
      "and tell me the interpretation thereof. Twenty geese I have\n",
      "in the house, that eat wheat, coming forth from the water,\n",
      "and I am gladdened at the sight. Now a great eagle of\n",
      "crooked beak swooped from the mountain, and brake all their\n",
      "necks and slew them; and they lay strewn in a heap in the\n",
      "halls, while he was borne aloft to the bright air. Thereon\n",
      "I wept and wailed, in a dream though it was, and around me\n",
      "were gathered the fair-tressed Achaean women as I made\n",
      "piteous lament, for that the eagle had slain my geese. But\n",
      "he came back and sat him down on a jutting point of the\n",
      "roof-beam, and with the voice of a man he spake, and stayed\n",
      "my weeping:\n",
      "\n",
      "'\"Take heart, O daughter of renowned Icarius; this is no\n",
      "dream but a true vision, that shall be accomplished for\n",
      "thee. The geese are the wooers, and I that before was the\n",
      "eagle am now thy husband come again, who will let slip\n",
      "unsightly death upon all the wooers.\" With that word sweet\n",
      "slumber let me go, and I looked about, and beheld the geese\n",
      "in the court pecking their wheat at the trough, where they\n",
      "were wont before.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said:\n",
      "'Lady, none may turn aside the dream to interpret it\n",
      "otherwise, seeing that Odysseus himself hath showed thee\n",
      "how he will fulfil it. For the wooers destruction is\n",
      "clearly boded, for all and every one; not a man shall avoid\n",
      "death and the fates.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then wise Penelope answered him: 'Stranger, verily dreams\n",
      "are hard, and hard to be discerned; nor are all things\n",
      "therein fulfilled for men. Twain are the gates of shadowy\n",
      "dreams, the one is fashioned of horn and one of ivory. Such\n",
      "dreams as pass through the portals of sawn ivory are\n",
      "deceitful, and bear tidings that are unfulfilled. But the\n",
      "dreams that come forth through the gates of polished horn\n",
      "bring a true issue, whosoever of mortals beholds them. Yet\n",
      "methinks my strange dream came not thence; of a truth that\n",
      "would be most welcome to me and to my son. But another\n",
      "thing will I tell thee, and do thou ponder it in thy heart.\n",
      "Lo, even now draws nigh the morn of evil name, that is to\n",
      "sever me from the house of Odysseus, for now I am about to\n",
      "ordain for a trial those axes that he would set up in a row\n",
      "in his halls, like stays of oak in ship-building, twelve in\n",
      "all, and he would stand far apart and shoot his arrow\n",
      "through them all. And now I will offer this contest to the\n",
      "wooers; whoso shall most easily string the bow in his\n",
      "hands, and shoot through all twelve axes, with him will I\n",
      "go and forsake this house, this house of my wedlock, so\n",
      "fair and filled with all livelihood, which methinks I shall\n",
      "yet remember, aye, in a dream.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her and said: 'Wife\n",
      "revered of Odysseus son of Laertes, no longer delay this\n",
      "contest in thy halls; for, lo, Odysseus of many counsels\n",
      "will be here, before these men, for all their handling of\n",
      "this polished bow, shall have strung it, and shot the arrow\n",
      "through the iron.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the wise Penelope answered him: 'Stranger, if only\n",
      "thou wert willing still to sit beside me in the halls and\n",
      "to delight me, not upon my eyelids would sleep be shed. But\n",
      "men may in no wise abide sleepless ever, for the immortals\n",
      "have made a time for all things for mortals on the\n",
      "grain-giving earth. Howbeit I will go aloft to my upper\n",
      "chamber, and lay me on my bed, the place of my groanings,\n",
      "that is ever watered by my tears, since the day that\n",
      "Odysseus went to see that evil Ilios, never to be named.\n",
      "There will I lay me down, but do thou lie in this house;\n",
      "either strew thee somewhat on the floor, or let them lay\n",
      "bedding for thee.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith she ascended to her shining upper chamber, not\n",
      "alone, for with her likewise went her handmaids. So she\n",
      "went aloft to her upper chamber with the women her\n",
      "handmaids, and there was bewailing Odysseus, her dear lord,\n",
      "till grey-eyed Athene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\n",

      "Book XX\n",
      "\n",
      "  Pallas and Odysseus consult of the killing of the wooers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the goodly Odysseus laid him down to sleep in the\n",
      "vestibule of the house. He spread an undressed bull's hide\n",
      "on the ground and above it many fleeces of sheep, that the\n",
      "Achaeans were wont to slay in sacrifice, and Eurynome threw\n",
      "a mantle over him where he lay. There Odysseus lay wakeful,\n",
      "with evil thoughts against the wooers in his heart. And the\n",
      "women came forth from their chamber, that aforetime were\n",
      "wont to lie with the wooers, making laughter and mirth\n",
      "among themselves. Then the heart of Odysseus was stirred\n",
      "within his breast, and much he communed with his mind and\n",
      "soul, whether he should leap forth upon them and deal death\n",
      "to each, or suffer them to lie with the proud wooers, now\n",
      "for the last and latest time. And his heart growled\n",
      "sullenly within him. And even as a bitch stands over her\n",
      "tender whelps growling, when she spies a man she knows not,\n",
      "and she is eager to assail him, so growled his heart within\n",
      "him in his wrath at their evil deeds. Then he smote upon\n",
      "his breast and rebuked his own heart, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Endure, my heart; yea, a baser thing thou once didst bear,\n",
      "on that day when the Cyclops, unrestrained in fury,\n",
      "devoured the mighty men of my company; but still thou didst\n",
      "endure till thy craft found a way for thee forth from out\n",
      "the cave, where thou thoughtest to die.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, chiding his own spirit within him, and his\n",
      "heart verily abode steadfast in obedience to his word. But\n",
      "Odysseus himself lay tossing this way and that. And as when\n",
      "a man by a great fire burning takes a paunch full of fat\n",
      "and blood, and turns it this way and that and longs to have\n",
      "it roasted most speedily, so Odysseus tossed from side to\n",
      "side, musing how he might stretch forth his hands upon the\n",
      "shameless wooers, being but one man against so many. Then\n",
      "down from heaven came Athene and drew nigh him, fashioned\n",
      "in the likeness of a woman. And she stood over his head and\n",
      "spake to him, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Lo now again, wherefore art thou watching, most luckless\n",
      "of all men living? Is not this thy house and is not thy\n",

      "have for their own?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: 'Yea,\n",
      "goddess, all this thou hast spoken as is meet. But my heart\n",
      "within me muses in some measure upon this, how I may\n",
      "stretch forth my hands upon the shameless wooers, being but\n",
      "one man, while they abide ever in their companies within.\n",
      "Moreover this other and harder matter I ponder in my heart:\n",
      "even if I were to slay them by thy will and the will of\n",
      "Zeus, whither should I flee from the avengers? Look well to\n",
      "this, I pray thee.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then answered the goddess, grey-eyed Athene: 'O hard of\n",
      "belief! yea, many there be that trust even in a weaker\n",
      "friend than I am, in one that is a mortal and knows not\n",
      "such craft as mine; but I am a god, that preserve thee to\n",
      "the end, in all manner of toils. And now I will tell thee\n",
      "plainly; even should fifty companies of mortal men compass\n",
      "us about eager to slay us in battle, even their kine\n",
      "shouldst thou drive off and their brave flocks. But let\n",
      "sleep in turn come over thee; to wake and to watch all\n",

      "So she spake and poured slumber upon his eyelids, but for\n",
      "her part the fair goddess went back to Olympus.\n",
      "\n",
      "While sleep laid hold of him loosening the cares of his\n",
      "soul, sleep that loosens the limbs of men, his good wife\n",
      "awoke and wept as she sat on her soft bed. But when she had\n",
      "taken her fill of weeping, to Artemis first the fair lady\n",
      "made her prayer:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Artemis, lady and goddess, daughter of Zeus, would that\n",
      "even now thou wouldst plant thy shaft within my breast and\n",
      "take my life away, even in this hour! Or else, would that\n",
      "the stormwind might snatch me up, and bear me hence down\n",
      "the dusky ways, and cast me forth where the back-flowing\n",
      "Oceanus mingles with the sea. It should be even as when the\n",
      "stormwinds bare away the daughters of Pandareus. Their\n",
      "father and their mother the gods had slain, and the maidens\n",
      "were left orphans in the halls, and fair Aphrodite\n",
      "cherished them with curds and sweet honey and delicious\n",
      "wine. And Here gave them beauty and wisdom beyond the lot\n",
      "of women, and holy Artemis dowered them with stature, and\n",
      "Athene taught them skill in all famous handiwork. Now while\n",
      "fair Aphrodite was wending to high Olympus, to pray that a\n",
      "glad marriage might be accomplished for the maidens,--and\n",
      "to Zeus she went whose joy is in the thunder, for he knows\n",
      "all things well, what the fates give and deny to mortal\n",
      "men--in the meanwhile the spirits of the storm snatched\n",
      "away these maidens, and gave them to be handmaids to the\n",
      "hateful Erinyes. Would that in such wise they that hold the\n",
      "mansions of Olympus would take me from the sight of men, or\n",
      "that fair-stressed Artemis would strike me, that so with a\n",
      "vision of Odysseus before mine eyes I might even pass\n",
      "beneath the dreadful earth, nor ever make a baser man's\n",
      "delight! But herein is an evil that may well be borne,\n",
      "namely, when a man weeps all the day long in great sorrow\n",
      "of heart, but sleep takes him in the night, for sleep makes\n",
      "him forgetful of all things, of good and evil, when once it\n",
      "has overshadowed his eyelids. But as for me, even the\n",
      "dreams that the gods send upon me are evil. For\n",
      "furthermore, this very night one seemed to lie by my side,\n",
      "in the likeness of my lord, as he was when he went with the\n",
      "host, and then was my heart glad, since methought it was no\n",
      "vain dream but a clear vision at the last.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So she spake, and anon came the golden throned Dawn. Now\n",
      "goodly Odysseus caught the voice of her weeping, and then\n",
      "he fell a musing, and it seemed to him that even now she\n",
      "knew him and was standing by his head. So he took up the\n",
      "mantle and the fleeces whereon he was lying, and set them\n",
      "on a high seat in the hall, and bare out the bull's hide\n",
      "out of doors and laid it there, and lifting up his hands he\n",
      "prayed to Zeus:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father Zeus, if ye gods of your good will have led me over\n",
      "wet and dry, to mine own country, after ye had plagued me\n",
      "sore, let some one I pray of the folk that are waking show\n",
      "me a word of good omen within, and without let some sign\n",
      "also be revealed to me from Zeus.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake in prayer, and Zeus, the counsellor, heard him.\n",
      "Straightway he thundered from shining Olympus, from on high\n",
      "from the place of clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad.\n",
      "Moreover a woman, a grinder at the mill, uttered a voice of\n",
      "omen from within the house hard by, where stood the mills\n",
      "of the shepherd of the people. At these handmills twelve\n",
      "women in all plied their task, making meal of barley and of\n",
      "wheat, the marrow of men. Now all the others were asleep,\n",
      "for they had ground out their task of grain, but one alone\n",
      "rested not yet, being the weakest of all. She now stayed\n",
      "her quern and spake a word, a sign to her lord:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father Zeus, who rulest over gods and men, loudly hast\n",
      "thou thundered from the starry sky, yet nowhere is there a\n",
      "cloud to be seen: this surely is a portent thou art showing\n",
      "to some mortal. Fulfil now, I pray thee, even to miserable\n",
      "me, the word that I shall speak. May the wooers, on this\n",
      "day, for the last and latest time make their sweet feasting\n",
      "in the halls of Odysseus! They that have loosened my knees\n",
      "with cruel toil to grind their barley meal, may they now\n",
      "sup their last!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus she spake, and goodly Odysseus was glad in the omen of\n",
      "the voice and in the thunder of Zeus; for he thought that\n",
      "he had gotten his vengeance on the guilty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the other maidens in the fair halls of Odysseus had\n",
      "gathered, and were kindling on the hearth the never-resting\n",
      "fire. And Telemachus rose from his bed, a godlike man, and\n",
      "put on his raiment, and slung a sharp sword about his\n",
      "shoulders, and beneath his shining feet he bound his goodly\n",
      "sandals. And he caught up his mighty spear shod with sharp\n",
      "bronze, and went and stood by the threshold, and spake to\n",
      "Eurycleia:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Dear nurse, have ye honoured our guest in the house with\n",
      "food and couch, or does he lie uncared for, as he may? For\n",
      "this is my mother's way, wise as she is: blindly she\n",
      "honours one of mortal men, even the worse, but the better\n",
      "she sends without honour away.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the prudent Eurycleia answered: 'Nay, my child, thou\n",
      "shouldst not now blame her where no blame is. For the\n",
      "stranger sat and drank wine, so long as he would, and of\n",
      "food he said he was no longer fain, for thy mother asked\n",
      "him. Moreover, against the hour when he should bethink him\n",
      "of rest and sleep, she bade the maidens strew for him a\n",
      "bed. But he, as one utterly wretched and ill-fated, refused\n",
      "to lie on a couch and under blankets, but on an undressed\n",
      "hide and on the fleeces of sheep he slept in the vestibule,\n",
      "and we cast a mantle over him.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So she spake, and Telemachus passed out through the hall\n",
      "with his lance in his hand, and two fleet dogs bare him\n",
      "company. He went on his way to the assembly-place to join\n",
      "the goodly-greaved Achaeans. But the good lady Eurycleia,\n",
      "daughter of Ops son of Peisenor, called aloud to her\n",
      "maidens:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come hither, let some of you go busily and sweep the hall,\n",
      "and sprinkle it, and on the fair-fashioned seats throw\n",
      "purple coverlets, and others with sponges wipe all the\n",
      "tables clean, and cleanse the mixing bowls and well-wrought\n",
      "double beakers, and others again go for water to the well,\n",
      "and return with it right speedily. For the wooers will not\n",
      "long be out of the hall but will return very early, for it\n",
      "is a feast day, yea for all the people.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So she spake, and they all gave ready ear and hearkened.\n",
      "Twenty of them went to the well of dark water, and the\n",
      "others there in the halls were busy with skilful hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in came the serving-men of the Achaeans. Thereon they\n",
      "cleft the faggots well and cunningly, while, behold, the\n",
      "women came back from the well. Then the swineherd joined\n",
      "them leading three fatted boars, the best in all the flock.\n",
      "These he left to feed at large in the fair courts, but as\n",
      "for him he spake to Odysseus gently, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tell me, stranger, do the Achaeans at all look on thee\n",
      "with more regard, or do they dishonour thee in the halls,\n",
      "as heretofore?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying:\n",
      "\n",

      "these men deal insolently, and devise infatuate deeds in\n",
      "another's house, and have no place for shame!'\n",
      "\n",
      "On such wise they spake one to another. And Melanthius drew\n",
      "near them, the goatherd, leading the goats that were most\n",
      "excellent in all the herds to be a dinner for the wooers,\n",
      "and two shepherds bare him company. So he tethered the\n",
      "goats beneath the echoing gallery, and himself spake to\n",
      "Odysseus and taunted him, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stranger, wilt thou still be a plague to us here in the\n",
      "hall, with thy begging of men, and wilt not get thee gone?\n",
      "In no wise do I think we twain will be sundered, till we\n",
      "taste each the other's fists, for thy begging is out of all\n",
      "order. Also there are elsewhere other feasts of the\n",
      "Achaeans.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, but Odysseus of many counsels answered him not\n",
      "a word, but in silence he shook his head, brooding evil in\n",
      "the deep of his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover a third man came up, Philoetius, a master of men,\n",
      "leading a barren heifer for the wooers and fatted goats.\n",
      "Now ferrymen had brought them over from the mainland,\n",
      "boatmen who send even other folks on their way, whosoever\n",
      "comes to them. The cattle he tethered carefully beneath the\n",
      "echoing gallery, and himself drew close to the swineherd,\n",
      "and began to question him:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Swineherd, who is this stranger but newly come to our\n",
      "house? From what men does he claim his birth? Where are his\n",
      "kin and his native fields? Hapless is he, yet in fashion he\n",
      "is like a royal lord; but the gods mar the goodliness of\n",
      "wandering men, when even for kings they have woven the web\n",
      "of trouble.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and came close to him offering his right hand\n",
      "in welcome, and uttering his voice spake to him winged\n",
      "words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father and stranger, hail! may happiness be thine in the\n",
      "time to come; but as now, thou art fast holden in many\n",
      "sorrows! Father Zeus, none other god is more baneful than\n",
      "thou; thou hast no compassion on men, that are of thine own\n",
      "begetting, but makest them to have fellowship with evil and\n",
      "with bitter pains. The sweat brake out on me when I beheld\n",
      "him, and mine eyes stand full of tears for memory of\n",
      "Odysseus, for he too, methinks, is clad in such vile\n",
      "raiment as this, and is wandering among men, if haply he\n",
      "yet lives and sees the sunlight. But if he be dead already\n",
      "and in the house of Hades, then woe is me for the noble\n",
      "Odysseus, who set me over his cattle while I was but a lad\n",
      "in the land of the Cephallenians. And now these wax\n",
      "numberless; in no better wise could the breed of\n",
      "broad-browed cattle of any mortal increase, even as the\n",
      "ears of corn. But strangers command me to be ever driving\n",
      "these for themselves to devour, and they care nothing for\n",
      "the heir in the house, nor tremble at the vengeance of the\n",
      "gods, for they are eager even now to divide among\n",
      "themselves the possessions of our lord who is long afar.\n",
      "Now my heart within my breast often revolves this thing.\n",
      "Truly it were an evil deed, while a son of the master is\n",
      "yet alive, to get me away to the land of strangers, and go\n",
      "off, with cattle and all, to alien men. But this is more\n",
      "grievous still, to abide here in affliction watching over\n",
      "the herds of other men. Yea, long ago I would have fled and\n",
      "gone forth to some other of the proud kings, for things are\n",
      "now past sufferance; but still my thought is of that\n",
      "hapless one, if he might come I know not whence, and make a\n",
      "scattering of the wooers in the halls.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Neatherd, seeing thou art not like to an evil man or a\n",
      "foolish, and of myself I mark how that thou hast gotten\n",
      "understanding of heart, therefore I will tell thee\n",
      "somewhat, and swear a great oath to confirm it. Be Zeus now\n",
      "my witness before any god, and the hospitable board and the\n",
      "hearth of noble Odysseus, whereunto I am come, that while\n",
      "thou art still in this place Odysseus shall come home, and\n",
      "thou shalt see with thine eyes, if thou wilt, the slaying\n",
      "of the wooers who lord it here.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the neatherd made answer, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, would, stranger, that Cronion may accomplish this\n",
      "word! So shouldst thou know what my might is, and how my\n",
      "hands follow to obey.'\n",
      "\n",
      "In like manner Eumaeus prayed to all the gods, that wise\n",
      "Odysseus might return to his own home.\n",
      "\n",
      "On such wise they spake one to the other, but the wooers at\n",
      "that time were framing death and doom for Telemachus. Even\n",
      "so there came by them a bird on their left, an eagle of\n",
      "lofty flight, with a cowering dove in his clutch. Then\n",
      "Amphinomus made harangue and spake among them:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friends, this counsel of ours will not go well, namely,\n",
      "the slaying of Telemachus; rather let us bethink us of the\n",
      "feast.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake Amphinomus, and his saying pleased them well. They\n",
      "passed into the halls of godlike Odysseus and laid by their\n",
      "mantles on the chairs and high seats, and sacrificed great\n",
      "sheep and stout goats and the fatlings of the boars and the\n",
      "heifer of the herd; then they roasted the entrails and\n",
      "served them round and mixed wine in the bowl, and the\n",
      "swineherd set a cup by each man. And Philoetius, a master\n",
      "of men, handed them wheaten bread in beautiful baskets, and\n",
      "Melanthius poured out the wine. So they put forth their\n",
      "hands on the good cheer set before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Telemachus, in his crafty purpose, made Odysseus to sit\n",
      "down within the stablished hall by the threshold of stone,\n",
      "and placed for him a mean settle and a little table. He set\n",
      "by him his mess of the entrails, and poured wine into a\n",
      "golden cup and spake to him, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'There, sit thee down, drinking thy wine among the lords,\n",
      "and the taunts and buffets of all the wooers I myself will\n",
      "ward off from thee, for this is no house of public resort,\n",
      "but the very house of Odysseus, and for me he won it. But,\n",
      "ye wooers, refrain your minds from rebukes and your hands\n",
      "from buffets, that no strife and feud may arise.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he said, and they all bit their lips and marvelled at\n",
      "Telemachus, in that he spake boldly. Then Antinous, son of\n",
      "Eupeithes, spake among them, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hard though the word be, let us accept it, Achaeans, even\n",
      "the word of Telemachus, though mightily he threatens us in\n",
      "his speech. For Zeus Cronion hath hindered us of our\n",
      "purpose, else would we have silenced him in our halls,\n",
      "shrill orator as he is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake Antinous, but Telemachus took no heed of his\n",
      "words. Now the henchmen were leading through the town the\n",
      "holy hecatomb of the gods, and lo, the long-haired Achaeans\n",
      "were gathered beneath the shady grove of Apollo, the prince\n",
      "of archery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when they had roasted the outer flesh and drawn it off\n",
      "the spits, they divided the messes and shared the glorious\n",
      "feast. And beside Odysseus they that waited set an equal\n",
      "share, the same as that which fell to themselves, for so\n",
      "Telemachus commanded, the dear son of divine Odysseus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Athene would in nowise suffer the lordly wooers to\n",
      "abstain from biting scorn, that the pain might sink yet the\n",
      "deeper into the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes. There\n",
      "was among the wooers a man of a lawless heart, Ctesippus\n",
      "was his name, and in Same was his home, who trusting,\n",
      "forsooth, to his vast possessions, was wooing the wife of\n",
      "Odysseus the lord long afar. And now he spake among the\n",
      "proud wooers:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hear me, ye lordly wooers, and I will say somewhat. The\n",
      "stranger verily has long had his due portion, as is meet,\n",
      "an equal share; for it is not fair nor just to rob the\n",
      "guests of Telemachus of their right, whosoever they may be\n",
      "that come to this house. Go to then, I also will bestow on\n",
      "him a stranger's gift, that he in turn may give a present\n",
      "either to the bath-woman, or to any other of the thralls\n",
      "within the house of godlike Odysseus.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith he caught up an ox's foot from the dish, where it\n",
      "lay, and hurled it with strong hand. But Odysseus lightly\n",
      "avoided it with a turn of his head, and smiled right grimly\n",
      "in his heart, and the ox's foot smote the well-builded\n",
      "wall. Then Telemachus rebuked Ctesippus, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Verily, Ctesippus, it has turned out happier for thy\n",
      "heart's pleasure as it is! Thou didst not smite the\n",
      "stranger, for he himself avoided that which was cast at\n",
      "him, else surely would I have struck thee through the midst\n",
      "with the sharp spear, and in place of wedding banquet thy\n",
      "father would have had to busy him about a funeral feast in\n",
      "this place. Wherefore let no man make show of unseemly\n",
      "deeds in this my house, for now I have understanding to\n",
      "discern both good and evil, but in time past I was yet a\n",
      "child. But as needs we must, we still endure to see these\n",
      "deeds, while sheep are slaughtered and wine drunken and\n",
      "bread devoured, for hard it is for one man to restrain\n",
      "many. But come, no longer work me harm out of an evil\n",
      "heart; but if ye be set on slaying me, even me, with the\n",
      "sword, even that would I rather endure, and far better\n",
      "would it be to die than to witness for ever these unseemly\n",
      "deeds--strangers shamefully entreated, and men haling the\n",
      "handmaidens in foul wise through the fair house.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and they were all hushed in silence. And late\n",
      "and at last spake among them Agelaus, son of Damastor:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friends, when a righteous word has been spoken, none\n",
      "surely would rebuke another with hard speech and be angry.\n",
      "Misuse ye not this stranger, nor any of the thralls that\n",
      "are in the house of godlike Odysseus. But to Telemachus\n",
      "himself I would speak a soft word and to his mother, if\n",
      "perchance it may find favour with the mind of those twain.\n",
      "So long as your hearts within you had hope of the wise\n",
      "Odysseus returning to his own house, so long none could be\n",
      "wroth that ye waited and held back the wooers in the halls,\n",
      "for so had it been better, if Odysseus had returned and\n",
      "come back to his own home. But now the event is plain, that\n",
      "he will return no more. Go then, sit by thy mother and tell\n",
      "her all, namely, that she must wed the best man that wooes\n",
      "her, and whose gives most gifts; so shalt thou with\n",
      "gladness live on the heritage of thy father, eating and\n",
      "drinking, while she cares for another's house.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then wise Telemachus answered, and said: 'Nay by Zeus,\n",
      "Agelaus, and by the griefs of my father, who far away\n",
      "methinks from Ithaca has perished or goes wandering, in\n",
      "nowise do I delay my mother's marriage; nay, I bid her be\n",
      "married to what man she will, and withal I offer gifts\n",
      "without number. But I do indeed feel shame to drive her\n",
      "forth from the hall, despite her will, by a word of\n",
      "compulsion; God forbid that ever this should be.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake Telemachus, but among the wooers Pallas Athene\n",
      "roused laughter unquenchable, and drave their wits\n",
      "wandering. And now they were laughing with alien lips, and\n",
      "blood-bedabbled was the flesh they ate, and their eyes were\n",
      "filled with tears and their soul was fain of lamentation.\n",
      "Then the godlike Theoclymenus spake among them:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, wretched men, what woe is this ye suffer? Shrouded in\n",
      "night are your heads and your faces and your knees, and\n",
      "kindled is the voice of wailing, and all cheeks are wet\n",
      "with tears, and the walls and the fair main-beams of the\n",

      "full is the court, of ghosts that hasten hellwards beneath\n",
      "the gloom, and the sun has perished out of heaven, and an\n",
      "evil mist has overspread the world.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and they all laughed sweetly at him. Then\n",
      "Eurymachus, son of Polybus, began to speak to them, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'The guest that is newly come from a strange land is beside\n",
      "himself. Quick, ye young men, and convey him forth out of\n",
      "doors, that he may go to the place of the gathering, since\n",
      "here he finds it dark as night.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: 'Eurymachus, in\n",
      "nowise do I seek guides of thee to send me on my way. Eyes\n",
      "have I, and ears, and both my feet, and a stable mind in my\n",
      "breast of no mean fashioning. With these I will go forth,\n",
      "for I see evil coming on you, which not one man of the\n",

      "came to Peiraeus who received him gladly. Then all the\n",

      "\n",
      "'Telemachus, no man is more luckless than thou in his\n",

      "whosoever he be, always longing for bread and wine, and\n",
      "skilled in no peaceful work nor any deed of war, but a mere\n",
      "burden of the earth. And this other fellow again must stand\n",
      "up to play the seer! Nay, but if thou wouldest listen to\n",

      "the house of wise Ortilochus. Now Odysseus had gone thither\n",
      "to recover somewhat that was owing to him from all the\n",
      "people, for the men of Messene had lifted three hundred\n",
      "sheep in benched ships from out of Ithaca, with the\n",
      "shepherds of the flock. In quest of these it was that\n",
      "Odysseus went on a far embassy, being yet a lad; for his\n",
      "father and the other elders sent him forth. Moreover,\n",
      "Iphitus came thither in his search for twelve brood mares,\n",
      "which he had lost, with sturdy mules at the teat. These\n",

      "latter end, when he came to the child of Zeus, hardy of\n",
      "heart, the man Heracles, that had knowledge of great\n",

      "house, in his frowardness, and had no regard for the\n",
      "vengeance of the gods, nor for the table which he spread\n",
      "before him; for after the meal he slew him, his guest\n",
      "though he was, and kept for himself in the halls the horses\n",
      "strong of hoof. After these was Iphitus asking, when he met\n",
      "with Odysseus, and he gave him the bow, which of old great\n",
      "Eurytus bare and had left at his death to his son in his\n",
      "lofty house. And Odysseus gave Iphitus a sharp sword and a\n",
      "mighty spear, for the beginning of a loving friendship; but\n",
      "never had they acquaintance one of another at the board;\n",
      "ere that might be, the son of Zeus slew Iphitus son of\n",
      "Eurytus, a man like to the immortals, the same that gave\n",
      "Odysseus the bow. But goodly Odysseus would never take it\n",
      "with him on the black ships, as he went to the wars, but\n",

      "quickly loosed the strap from the handle of the door, and\n",

      "the hand of anyone in our land, and anon we will send thee\n",
      "in a black ship to Echetus, the maimer of all men, and\n",
      "thence thou shalt not be saved alive. Nay then, drink at\n",

      "think if yonder stranger strings the great bow of Odysseus,\n",
      "in the pride of his might and of his strength of arm, that\n",
      "he will lead me to his home and make me his wife? Nay he\n",

      "him in a mantle and a doublet, goodly raiment, and I will\n",
      "give him a sharp javelin to defend him against dogs and\n",
      "men, and a two-edged sword and sandals to bind beneath his\n",

      "Even so they spake, and he took and set down the bow in\n",
      "that very place, being affrighted because many cried out on\n",
      "him in the halls. Then Telemachus from the other side spake\n",
      "threateningly, and called aloud:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father, bring hither the bow, soon shalt thou rue it that\n",
      "thou servest many masters. Take heed, lest I that am\n",
      "younger than thou pursue thee to the field, and pelt thee\n",
      "with stones, for in might I am the better. If only I were\n",
      "so much mightier in strength of arm than all the wooers\n",
      "that are in the halls, soon would I send many an one forth\n",
      "on a woeful way from out our house, for they imagine\n",
      "mischief against us.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and all the wooers laughed sweetly at him, and\n",
      "ceased now from their cruel anger toward Telemachus. Then\n",
      "the swineherd bare the bow through the hall, and went up to\n",
      "wise Odysseus, and set it in his hands. And he called forth\n",
      "the nurse Eurycleia from the chamber and spake to her:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Wise Eurycleia, Telemachus bids thee bar the well-fitting\n",
      "doors of thy chamber, and if any of the women hear the\n",
      "sound of groaning or the din of men within our walls, let\n",
      "them not go forth, but abide where they are in silence at\n",
      "their work.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and wingless her speech remained, and she\n",
      "barred the doors of the fair-lying chambers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Philoetius hasted forth silently from the house, and\n",
      "barred the outer gates of the fenced court. Now there lay\n",
      "beneath the gallery the cable of a curved ship, fashioned\n",
      "of the byblus plant, wherewith he made fast the gates, and\n",
      "then himself passed within. Then he went and sat on the\n",
      "settle whence he had risen, and gazed upon Odysseus. He\n",
      "already was handling the bow, turning it every way about,\n",
      "and proving it on this side and on that, lest the worms\n",
      "might have eaten the horns when the lord of the bow was\n",
      "away. And thus men spake looking each one to his neighbour:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Verily he has a good eye, and a shrewd turn for a bow!\n",
      "Either, methinks, he himself has such a bow lying by at\n",
      "home or else he is set on making one, in such wise does he\n",
      "turn it hither and thither in his hands, this evil-witted\n",
      "beggar.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And another again of the haughty youths would say: 'Would\n",
      "that the fellow may have profit thereof, just so surely as\n",
      "he shall ever prevail to bend this bow!'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake the wooers, but Odysseus of many counsels had\n",
      "lifted the great bow and viewed it on every side, and even\n",
      "as when a man that is skilled in the lyre and in\n",
      "minstrelsy, easily stretches a cord about a new peg, after\n",
      "tying at either end the twisted sheep-gut, even so Odysseus\n",
      "straightway bent the great bow, all without effort, and\n",
      "took it in his right hand and proved the bow-string, which\n",
      "rang sweetly at the touch, in tone like a swallow. Then\n",
      "great grief came upon the wooers, and the colour of their\n",
      "countenance was changed, and Zeus thundered loud showing\n",
      "forth his tokens. And the steadfast goodly Odysseus was\n",
      "glad thereat, in that the son of deep-counselling Cronos\n",
      "had sent him a sign. Then he caught up a swift arrow which\n",
      "lay by his table, bare, but the other shafts were stored\n",
      "within the hollow quiver, those whereof the Achaeans were\n",
      "soon to taste. He took and laid it on the bridge of the\n",
      "bow, and held the notch and drew the string, even from the\n",
      "settle whereon he sat, and with straight aim shot the shaft\n",
      "and missed not one of the axes, beginning from the first\n",
      "axe-handle, and the bronze-weighted shaft passed clean\n",
      "through and out at the last. Then he spake to Telemachus,\n",
      "saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Telemachus, thy guest that sits in the halls does thee no\n",
      "shame. In nowise did I miss my mark, nor was I wearied with\n",
      "long bending of the bow. Still is my might steadfast--not\n",
      "as the wooers say scornfully to slight me. But now is it\n",
      "time that supper too be got ready for the Achaeans, while\n",
      "it is yet light, and thereafter must we make other sport\n",
      "with the dance and the lyre, for these are the crown of the\n",
      "feast.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith he nodded with bent brows, and Telemachus, the\n",
      "dear son of divine Odysseus, girt his sharp sword about him\n",
      "and took the spear in his grasp, and stood by his high seat\n",
      "at his father's side, armed with the gleaming bronze.\n",

      "  The killing of the wooers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels stripped him of his rags and\n",
      "leaped on to the great threshold with his bow and quiver\n",
      "full of arrows, and poured forth all the swift shafts there\n",
      "before his feet, and spake among the wooers:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Lo, now is this terrible trial ended at last; and now will\n",
      "I know of another mark, which never yet man has smitten, if\n",
      "perchance I may hit it and Apollo grant me renown.'\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he pointed the bitter arrow at Antinous. Now he\n",
      "was about raising to his lips a fair twy-eared chalice of\n",
      "gold, and behold, he was handling it to drink of the wine,\n",
      "and death was far from his thoughts. For who among men at\n",
      "feast would deem that one man amongst so many, how hardy\n",
      "soever he were, would bring on him foul death and black\n",
      "fate? But Odysseus aimed and smote him with the arrow in\n",
      "the throat, and the point passed clean out through his\n",
      "delicate neck, and he fell sidelong and the cup dropped\n",
      "from his hand as he was smitten, and at once through his\n",
      "nostrils there came up a thick jet of slain man's blood,\n",
      "and quickly he spurned the table from him with his foot,\n",
      "and spilt the food on the ground, and the bread and the\n",
      "roast flesh were defiled. Then the wooers raised a clamour\n",
      "through the halls when they saw the man fallen, and they\n",
      "leaped from their high seats, as men stirred by fear, all\n",
      "through the hall, peering everywhere along the well-builded\n",
      "walls, and nowhere was there a shield or mighty spear to\n",
      "lay hold on. Then they reviled Odysseus with angry words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stranger, thou shootest at men to thy hurt. Never again\n",
      "shalt thou enter other lists, now is utter doom assured\n",
      "thee. Yea, for now hast thou slain the man that was far the\n",
      "best of all the noble youths in Ithaca; wherefore vultures\n",
      "shall devour thee here.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So each one spake, for indeed they thought that Odysseus\n",
      "had not slain him wilfully; but they knew not in their\n",
      "folly that on their own heads, each and all of them, the\n",
      "bands of death had been made fast. Then Odysseus of many\n",
      "counsels looked fiercely on them, and spake:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ye dogs, ye said in your hearts that I should never more\n",
      "come home from the land of the Trojans, in that ye wasted\n",
      "my house, and lay with the maidservants by force, and\n",
      "traitorously wooed my wife while I was yet alive, and ye\n",
      "had no fear of the gods, that hold the wide heaven, nor of\n",
      "the indignation of men hereafter. But now the bands of\n",
      "death have been made fast upon you one and all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so he spake, and pale fear gat hold on the limbs of\n",
      "all, and each man looked about, where he might shun utter\n",
      "doom. And Eurymachus alone answered him, and spake: 'If\n",
      "thou art indeed Odysseus of Ithaca, come home again, with\n",
      "right thou speakest thus, of all that the Achaeans have\n",
      "wrought, many infatuate deeds in thy halls and many in the\n",
      "field. Howbeit, he now lies dead that is to blame for all,\n",
      "Antinous; for he brought all these things upon us, not as\n",
      "longing very greatly for the marriage nor needing it sore,\n",
      "but with another purpose, that Cronion has not fulfilled\n",
      "for him, namely, that he might himself be king over all the\n",
      "land of stablished Ithaca, and he was to have lain in wait\n",
      "for thy son and killed him. But now he is slain after his\n",
      "deserving, and do thou spare thy people, even thine own;\n",
      "and we will hereafter go about the township and yield thee\n",
      "amends for all that has been eaten and drunken in thy\n",
      "halls, each for himself bringing atonement of twenty oxen\n",
      "worth, and requiting thee in gold and bronze till thy heart\n",
      "is softened, but till then none may blame thee that thou\n",
      "art angry.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels looked fiercely on him, and\n",
      "said: 'Eurymachus, not even if ye gave me all your\n",
      "heritage, all that ye now have, and whatsoever else ye\n",
      "might in any wise add thereto, not even so would I\n",
      "henceforth hold my hands from slaying, ere the wooers had\n",
      "paid for all their transgressions. And now the choice lies\n",
      "before you, whether to fight in fair battle or to fly, if\n",
      "any may avoid death and the fates. But there be some,\n",
      "methinks, that shall not escape from utter doom.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He spake, and their knees were straightway loosened and\n",
      "their hearts melted within them. And Eurymachus spake among\n",
      "them yet again:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friends, it is plain that this man will not hold his\n",
      "unconquerable hands, but now that he has caught up the\n",
      "polished bow and quiver, he will shoot from the smooth\n",
      "threshold, till he has slain us all; wherefore let us take\n",
      "thought for the delight of battle. Draw your blades, and\n",
      "hold up the tables to ward off the arrows of swift death,\n",
      "and let us all have at him with one accord, and drive him,\n",
      "if it may be, from the threshold and the doorway and then\n",
      "go through the city, and quickly would the cry be raised.\n",
      "Thereby should this man soon have shot his latest bolt.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith he drew his sharp two-edged sword of bronze, and\n",
      "leapt on Odysseus with a terrible cry, but in the same\n",
      "moment goodly Odysseus shot the arrow forth and struck him\n",
      "on the breast by the pap, and drave the swift shaft into\n",
      "his liver. So he let the sword fall from his hand, and\n",
      "grovelling over the table he bowed and fell, and spilt the\n",
      "food and the two-handled cup on the floor. And in his agony\n",
      "he smote the ground with his brow, and spurning with both\n",
      "his feet he overthrew the high seat, and the mist of death\n",
      "was shed upon his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Amphinomus made at renowned Odysseus, setting straight\n",
      "at him, and drew his sharp sword, if perchance he might\n",
      "make him give ground from the door. But Telemachus was\n",
      "beforehand with him, and cast and smote him from behind\n",
      "with a bronze-shod spear between the shoulders, and drave\n",
      "it out through the breast, and he fell with a crash and\n",
      "struck the ground full with his forehead. Then Telemachus\n",
      "sprang away, leaving the long spear fixed in Amphinomus,\n",
      "for he greatly dreaded lest one of the Achaeans might run\n",
      "upon him with his blade, and stab him as he drew forth the\n",
      "spear, or smite him with a down stroke {*} of the sword. So\n",
      "he started and ran and came quickly to his father, and\n",
      "stood by him, and spake winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "{* Or, reading [Greek], smite him as he stooped over the\n",
      "corpse.}\n",
      "\n",
      "'Father, lo, now I will bring thee a shield and two spears\n",
      "and a helmet all of bronze, close fitting on the temples,\n",
      "and when I return I will arm myself, and likewise give arms\n",
      "to the swineherd and to the neatherd yonder: for it is\n",
      "better to be clad in full armour.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Odysseus of many counsels answered him saying: 'Run and\n",
      "bring them while I have arrows to defend me, lest they\n",
      "thrust me from the doorway, one man against them all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and Telemachus obeyed his dear father, and\n",
      "went forth to the chamber, where his famous weapons were\n",
      "lying. Thence he took out four shields and eight spears,\n",
      "and four helmets of bronze, with thick plumes of horse\n",
      "hair, and he started to bring them and came quickly to his\n",
      "father. Now he girded the gear of bronze about his own body\n",
      "first, and in like manner the two thralls did on the goodly\n",
      "armour, and stood beside the wise and crafty Odysseus. Now\n",
      "he, so long as he had arrows to defend him, kept aiming and\n",
      "smote the wooers one by one in his house, and they fell\n",
      "thick one upon another. But when the arrows failed the\n",
      "prince in his archery, he leaned his bow against the\n",
      "doorpost of the stablished hall, against the shining faces\n",
      "of the entrance. As for him he girt his fourfold shield\n",
      "about his shoulders and bound on his mighty head a well\n",
      "wrought helmet, with horse hair crest, and terribly the\n",
      "plume waved aloft. And he grasped two mighty spears tipped\n",
      "with bronze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now there was in the well-builded wall a certain postern\n",
      "raised above the floor, and there by the topmost level of\n",
      "the threshold of the stablished hall, was a way into an\n",
      "open passage, closed by well-fitted folding doors. So\n",
      "Odysseus bade the goodly swineherd stand near thereto and\n",
      "watch the way, for thither there was but one approach. Then\n",
      "Agelaus spake among them, and declared his word to all:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friends, will not some man climb up to the postern, and\n",
      "give word to the people, and a cry would be raised\n",
      "straightway; so should this man soon have shot his latest\n",
      "bolt?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Melanthius, the goatherd, answered him, saying: 'It\n",
      "may in no wise be, prince Agelaus; for the fair gate of the\n",
      "courtyard is terribly nigh, and perilous is the entrance to\n",
      "the passage, and one man, if he were valiant, might keep\n",
      "back a host. But come, let me bring you armour from the\n",
      "inner chamber, that ye may be clad in hauberks, for,\n",
      "methinks, within that room and not elsewhere did Odysseus\n",
      "and his renowned son lay by the arms.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith Melanthius, the goatherd, climbed up by the\n",
      "clerestory of the hall to the inner chambers of Odysseus,\n",
      "whence he took twelve shields and as many spears, and as\n",
      "many helmets of bronze with thick plumes of horse hair, and\n",
      "he came forth and brought them speedily, and gave them to\n",
      "the wooers. Then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and\n",
      "his heart melted within him, when he saw them girding on\n",
      "the armour and brandishing the long spears in their hands,\n",
      "and great, he saw, was the adventure. Quickly he spake to\n",
      "Telemachus winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Telemachus, sure I am that one of the women in the halls\n",
      "is stirring up an evil battle against us, or perchance it\n",
      "is Melanthius.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then wise Telemachus answered him: 'My father, it is I that\n",
      "have erred herein and none other is to blame, for I left\n",
      "the well-fitted door of the chamber open, and there has\n",
      "been one of them but too quick to spy it. Go now, goodly\n",
      "Eumaeus, and close the door of the chamber, and mark if it\n",

      "Melanthius, son of Dolius, as methinks it is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so they spake one to the other. And Melanthius, the\n",
      "goatherd, went yet again to the chamber to bring the fair\n",
      "armour. But the goodly swineherd was ware thereof, and\n",
      "quickly he spake to Odysseus who stood nigh him:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus, of many\n",

      "waiting on either side the doorposts. And when Melanthius,\n",
      "the goatherd, was crossing the threshold with a goodly helm\n",
      "in one hand, and in the other a wide shield and an old,\n",
      "stained with rust, the shield of the hero Laertes that he\n",
      "bare when he was young--but at that time it was laid by,\n",
      "and the seams of the straps were loosened,--then the twain\n",
      "rushed on him and caught him, and dragged him in by the\n",

      "There they stood breathing fury, four men by the threshold,\n",
      "while those others within the halls were many and good\n",
      "warriors. Then Athene, daughter of Zeus, drew nigh them,\n",
      "like Mentor in fashion and in voice, and Odysseus was glad\n",
      "when he saw her and spake, saying:\n",

      "of the host. But the wooers on the other side shouted in\n",
      "the halls, and first Agelaus son of Damastor rebuked\n",
      "Athene, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mentor, let not the speech of Odysseus beguile thee to\n",
      "fight against the wooers, and to succour him. For methinks\n",
      "that on this wise we shall work our will. When we shall\n",
      "have slain these men, father and son, thereafter shalt thou\n",
      "perish with them, such deeds thou art set on doing in these\n",
      "halls; nay, with thine own head shalt thou pay the price.\n",
      "But when with the sword we shall have overcome your\n",
      "violence, we will mingle all thy possessions, all that thou\n",

      "\n",
      "So spake he, and Athene was mightily angered at heart, and\n",

      "whole years continually thou didst battle with the Trojans\n",
      "for high born Helen, of the white arms, and many men thou\n",
      "slewest in terrible warfare, and by thy device the\n",
      "wide-wayed city of Priam was taken. How then, now that thou\n",
      "art come to thy house and thine own possessions, dost thou\n",
      "bewail thee and art of feeble courage to stand before the\n",
      "wooers? Nay, come hither, friend, and stand by me, and I\n",
      "will show thee a thing, that thou mayest know what manner\n",
      "of man is Mentor, son of Alcimus, to repay good deeds in\n",
      "the ranks of foemen.'\n",
      "\n",
      "She spake, and gave him not yet clear victory in full, but\n",
      "still for a while made trial of the might and prowess of\n",
      "Odysseus and his renowned son. As for her she flew up to\n",
      "the roof timber of the murky hall, in such fashion as a\n",
      "swallow flies, and there sat down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Agelaus, son of Damastor, urged on the wooers, and\n",

      "Peisandrus son of Polyctor, and wise Polybus, for these\n",
      "were in valiancy far the best men of the wooers, that still\n",
      "lived and fought for their lives; for the rest had fallen\n",
      "already beneath the bow and the thick rain of arrows. Then\n",
      "Agelaus spake among them, and made known his word to all:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friends, now at last will this man hold his unconquerable\n",
      "hands. Lo, now has Mentor left him and spoken but vain\n",
      "boasts, and these remain alone at the entrance of the\n",
      "doors. Wherefore now, throw not your long spears all\n",
      "together, but come, do ye six cast first, if perchance Zeus\n",
      "may grant us to smite Odysseus and win renown. Of the rest\n",
      "will we take no heed, so soon as that man shall have\n",
      "fallen.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake and they all cast their javelins, as he bade\n",
      "them, eagerly; but behold, Athene so wrought that they were\n",
      "all in vain. One man smote the doorpost of the stablished\n",
      "hall, and another the well-fastened door, and the ashen\n",
      "spear of yet another wooer, heavy with bronze, stuck fast\n",
      "in the wall. So when they had avoided all the spears of the\n",
      "wooers, the steadfast goodly Odysseus began first to speak\n",
      "among them:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friends, now my word is that we too cast and hurl into the\n",

      "beyond the measure of their former iniquities.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and they all took good aim and threw their\n",
      "sharp spears, and Odysseus smote Demoptolemus, and\n",
      "Telemachus Euryades, and the swineherd slew Elatus, and the\n",
      "neatherd Peisandrus. Thus they all bit the wide floor with\n",
      "their teeth, and the wooers fell back into the inmost part\n",
      "of the hall. But the others dashed upon them and drew forth\n",
      "the shafts from the bodies of the dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then once more the wooers threw their sharp spears eagerly;\n",
      "but behold, Athene so wrought that many of them were in\n",
      "vain. One man smote the door-post of the stablished hall,\n",
      "and another the well-fastened door, and the ashen spear of\n",
      "another wooer, heavy with bronze, struck in the wall. Yet\n",
      "Amphimedon hit Telemachus on the hand by the wrist lightly,\n",
      "and the shaft of bronze wounded the surface of the skin.\n",
      "And Ctesippus grazed the shoulder of Eumaeus with a long\n",
      "spear high above the shield, and the spear flew over and\n",
      "fell to the ground. Then again Odysseus, the wise and\n",
      "crafty, he and his men cast their swift spears into the\n",
      "press of the wooers, and now once more Odysseus, waster of\n",
      "cities, smote Eurydamas, and Telemachus Amphimedon, and the\n",
      "swineherd slew Polybus, and last, the neatherd struck\n",
      "Ctesippus in the breast and boasted over him, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'O son of Polytherses, thou lover of jeering, never give\n",
      "place at all to folly to speak so big, but leave thy case\n",
      "to the gods, since in truth they are far mightier than\n",
      "thou. This gift is thy recompense for the ox-foot that thou\n",
      "gavest of late to the divine Odysseus, when he went begging\n",
      "through the house.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake the keeper of the shambling kine. Next Odysseus\n",
      "wounded the son of Damastor in close fight with his long\n",
      "spear, and Telemachus wounded Leocritus son of Euenor,\n",
      "right in the flank with his lance, and drave the bronze\n",
      "point clean through, that he fell prone and struck the\n",
      "ground full with his forehead. Then Athene held up her\n",
      "destroying aegis on high from the roof, and their minds\n",
      "were scared, and they fled through the hall, like a drove\n",
      "of kine that the flitting gadfly falls upon and scatters\n",
      "hither and thither in spring time, when the long days\n",
      "begin. But the others set on like vultures of crooked claws\n",
      "and curved beak, that come forth from the mountains and\n",
      "dash upon smaller birds, and these scour low in the plain,\n",
      "stooping in terror from the clouds, while the vultures\n",
      "pounce on them and slay them, and there is no help nor way\n",
      "of flight, and men are glad at the sport; even so did the\n",
      "company of Odysseus set upon the wooers and smite them\n",
      "right and left through the hall; and there rose a hideous\n",
      "moaning as their heads were smitten, and the floor all ran\n",
      "with blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Leiodes took hold of the knees of Odysseus eagerly, and\n",
      "besought him and spake winged words: 'I entreat thee by thy\n",
      "knees, Odysseus, and do thou show mercy on me and have\n",
      "pity. For never yet, I say, have I wronged a maiden in thy\n",
      "halls by froward word or deed, nay I bade the other wooers\n",
      "refrain, whoso of them wrought thus. But they hearkened not\n",
      "unto me to keep their hands from evil. Wherefore they have\n",
      "met a shameful death through their own infatuate deeds.\n",
      "Yet I, the soothsayer among them, that have wrought no\n",
      "evil, shall fall even as they, for no grace abides for good\n",
      "deeds done.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels looked askance at him, and\n",
      "said: 'If indeed thou dost avow thee to be the soothsayer\n",
      "of these men, thou art like to have often prayed in the\n",
      "halls that the issue of a glad return might be far from me,\n",
      "and that my dear wife should follow thee and bear thee\n",
      "children; wherefore thou shalt not escape the bitterness of\n",
      "death.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith he caught up a sword in his strong hand, that lay\n",
      "where Agelaus had let it fall to the ground when he was\n",
      "slain, and drave it clean through his neck, and as he yet\n",
      "spake his head fell even to the dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the son of Terpes, the minstrel, still sought how he\n",
      "might shun black fate, Phemius, who sang among the wooers\n",
      "of necessity. He stood with the loud lyre in his hand hard\n",
      "by the postern gate, and his heart was divided within him,\n",
      "whether he should slip forth from the hall and sit down by\n",
      "the well-wrought altar of great Zeus of the household\n",
      "court, whereon Laertes and Odysseus had burnt many pieces\n",
      "of the thighs of oxen, or should spring forward and beseech\n",
      "Odysseus by his knees. And as he thought thereupon this\n",
      "seemed to him the better way, to embrace the knees of\n",
      "Odysseus, son of Laertes. So he laid the hollow lyre on the\n",
      "ground between the mixing-bowl and the high seat inlaid\n",
      "with silver, and himself sprang forward and seized Odysseus\n",
      "by the knees, and besought him and spake winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'I entreat thee by thy knees, Odysseus, and do thou show\n",
      "mercy on me and have pity. It will be a sorrow to thyself\n",
      "in the aftertime if thou slayest me who am a minstrel, and\n",
      "sing before gods and men. Yea none has taught me but\n",
      "myself, and the god has put into my heart all manner of\n",
      "lays, and methinks I sing to thee as to a god, wherefore be\n",
      "not eager to cut off my head. And Telemachus will testify\n",
      "of this, thine own dear son, that not by mine own will or\n",
      "desire did I resort to thy house to sing to the wooers at\n",
      "their feasts; but being so many and stronger than I they\n",
      "led me by constraint.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and the mighty prince Telemachus heard him and\n",
      "quickly spake to his father at his side: 'Hold thy hand,\n",
      "and wound not this blameless man with the sword; and let us\n",
      "save also the henchman Medon, that ever had charge of me in\n",
      "our house when I was a child, unless perchance Philoetius\n",
      "or the swineherd have already slain him, or he hath met\n",
      "thee in thy raging through the house.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and Medon, wise of heart, heard him. For he\n",
      "lay crouching beneath a high seat, clad about in the\n",
      "new-flayed hide of an ox and shunned black fate. So he rose\n",
      "up quickly from under the seat, and cast off the ox-hide,\n",
      "and sprang forth and caught Telemachus by the knees, and\n",
      "besought him and spake winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friend, here am I; prithee stay thy hand and speak to thy\n",
      "father, lest he harm me with the sharp sword in the\n",
      "greatness of his strength, out of his anger for the wooers\n",
      "that wasted his possessions in the halls, and in their\n",
      "folly held thee in no honour.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Odysseus of many counsels smiled on him and said: 'Take\n",
      "courage, for lo, he has saved thee and delivered thee, that\n",
      "thou mayst know in thy heart, and tell it even to another,\n",
      "how far more excellent are good deeds than evil. But go\n",
      "forth from the halls and sit down in the court apart from\n",
      "the slaughter, thou and the full-voiced minstrel, till I\n",
      "have accomplished all that I must needs do in the house.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith the two went forth and gat them from the hall. So\n",
      "they sat down by the altar of great Zeus, peering about on\n",
      "every side, still expecting death. And Odysseus peered all\n",
      "through the house, to see if any man was yet alive and\n",
      "hiding away to shun black fate. But he found all the sort\n",
      "of them fallen in their blood in the dust, like fishes that\n",
      "the fishermen have drawn forth in the meshes of the net\n",
      "into a hollow of the beach from out the grey sea, and all\n",
      "the fish, sore longing for the salt sea waves, are heaped\n",
      "upon the sand, and the sun shines forth and takes their\n",
      "life away; so now the wooers lay heaped upon each other.\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels spake to Telemachus:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Telemachus, go, call me the nurse Eurycleia, that I may\n",
      "tell her a word that is on my mind.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and Telemachus obeyed his dear father, and\n",
      "smote at the door, and spake to the nurse Eurycleia: 'Up\n",
      "now, aged wife, that overlookest all the women servants in\n",
      "our halls, come hither, my father calls thee and has\n",
      "somewhat to say to thee.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so he spake, and wingless her speech remained, and she\n",
      "opened the doors of the fair-lying halls, and came forth,\n",
      "and Telemachus led the way before her. So she found\n",
      "Odysseus among the bodies of the dead, stained with blood\n",
      "and soil of battle, like a lion that has eaten of an ox of\n",
      "the homestead and goes on his way, and all his breast and\n",
      "his cheeks on either side are flecked with blood, and he is\n",
      "terrible to behold; even so was Odysseus stained, both\n",
      "hands and feet. Now the nurse, when she saw the bodies of\n",
      "the dead and the great gore of blood, made ready to cry\n",
      "aloud for joy, beholding so great an adventure. But\n",
      "Odysseus checked and held her in her eagerness, and\n",
      "uttering his voice spake to her winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Within thine own heart rejoice, old nurse, and be still,\n",
      "and cry not aloud; for it is an unholy thing to boast over\n",
      "slain men. Now these hath the destiny of the gods overcome,\n",
      "and their own cruel deeds, for they honoured none of\n",
      "earthly men, neither the bad nor yet the good, that came\n",
      "among them. Wherefore they have met a shameful death\n",
      "through their own infatuate deeds. But come, tell me the\n",
      "tale of the women in my halls, which of them dishonour me,\n",
      "and which be guiltless.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered him: 'Yea now, my\n",
      "child, I will tell thee all the truth. Thou hast fifty\n",
      "women-servants in thy halls, that we have taught the ways\n",
      "of housewifery, how to card wool and to bear bondage. Of\n",
      "these twelve in all have gone the way of shame, and honour\n",
      "not me, nor their lady Penelope. And Telemachus hath but\n",
      "newly come to his strength, and his mother suffered him not\n",
      "to take command over the women in this house. But now, let\n",
      "me go aloft to the shining upper chamber, and tell all to\n",
      "thy wife, on whom some god hath sent a sleep.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: 'Wake\n",
      "her not yet, but bid the women come hither, who in time\n",
      "past behaved themselves unseemly.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and the old wife passed through the hall, to\n",
      "tell the women and to hasten their coming. Then Odysseus\n",
      "called to him Telemachus, and the neatherd, and the\n",
      "swineherd, and spake to them winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Begin ye now to carry out the dead, and bid the women help\n",
      "you, and thereafter cleanse the fair high seats and the\n",
      "tables with water and porous sponges. And when ye have set\n",
      "all the house in order, lead the maidens without the\n",
      "stablished hall, between the vaulted room and the goodly\n",
      "fence of the court, and there slay them with your long\n",
      "blades, till they shall have all given up the ghost and\n",
      "forgotten the love that of old they had at the bidding of\n",
      "the wooers, in secret dalliance.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so he spake, and the women came all in a crowd\n",
      "together, making a terrible lament and shedding big tears.\n",
      "So first they carried forth the bodies of the slain, and\n",
      "set them beneath the gallery of the fenced court, and\n",
      "propped them one on another; and Odysseus himself hasted\n",
      "the women and directed them, and they carried forth the\n",
      "dead perforce. Thereafter they cleansed the fair high seats\n",
      "and the tables with water and porous sponges. And\n",
      "Telemachus, and the neatherd, and the swineherd, scraped\n",
      "with spades the floor of the well-builded house, and,\n",
      "behold, the maidens carried all forth and laid it without\n",
      "the doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when they had made an end of setting the hall in order,\n",
      "they led the maidens forth from the stablished hall, and\n",
      "drove them up in a narrow space between the vaulted room\n",
      "and the goodly fence of the court, whence none might avoid;\n",
      "and wise Telemachus began to speak to his fellows, saying:\n",
      "'God forbid that I should take these women's lives by a\n",
      "clean death, these that have poured dishonour on my head\n",
      "and on my mother, and have lain with the wooers.'\n",
      "\n",
      "With that word he tied the cable of a dark-prowed ship to a\n",
      "great pillar and flung it round the vaulted room, and\n",
      "fastened it aloft, that none might touch the ground with\n",
      "her feet. And even as when thrushes, long of wing, or doves\n",
      "fall into a net that is set in a thicket, as they seek to\n",
      "their roosting-place, and a loathly bed harbours them, even\n",
      "so the women held their heads all in a row, and about all\n",
      "their necks nooses were cast, that they might die by the\n",
      "most pitiful death. And they writhed with their feet for a\n",
      "little space, but for no long while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they led out Melanthius through the doorway and the\n",
      "court, and cut off his nostrils and his ears with the\n",
      "pitiless sword, and drew forth his vitals for the dogs to\n",
      "devour raw, and cut off his hands and feet in their cruel\n",
      "anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter they washed their hands and feet, and went into\n",

      "the maidens in the chambers to take to them their garments.\n",

      "wayfarer or one of those that dwell around, say that it is\n",
      "a wedding feast. And thus the slaughter of the wooers shall\n",
      "not be noised abroad through the town before we go forth to\n",
      "our well-wooded farm-land. Thereafter shall we consider\n",
      "what gainful counsel the Olympian may vouchsafe us.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and they gave good ear and hearkened to him.\n",
      "So first they went to the bath, and arrayed them in\n",
      "doublets, and the women were apparelled, and the divine\n",
      "minstrel took the hollow harp, and aroused in them the\n",
      "desire of sweet song and of the happy dance. Then the great\n",
      "hall rang round them with the sound of the feet of dancing\n",
      "men and of fair-girdled women. And whoso heard it from\n",
      "without would say:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Surely some one has wedded the queen of many wooers. Hard\n",
      "of heart was she, nor had she courage to keep the great\n",
      "house of her wedded lord continually till his coming.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so men spake, and knew not how these things were\n",
      "ordained. Meanwhile, the house-dame Eurynome had bathed the\n",
      "great-hearted Odysseus within his house, and anointed him\n",
      "with olive-oil, and cast about him a goodly mantle and a\n",
      "doublet. Moreover Athene shed great beauty from his head\n",
      "downwards, and made him greater and more mighty to behold,\n",
      "and from his head caused deep curling locks to flow, like\n",
      "the hyacinth flower. And as when some skilful man overlays\n",
      "gold upon silver, one that Hephaestus and Pallas Athene\n",
      "have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is his\n",
      "handiwork, even so did Athene shed grace about his head and\n",
      "shoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in form like to\n",
      "the immortals. Then he sat down again on the high seat,\n",
      "whence he had arisen, over against his wife, and spake to\n",
      "her, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Strange lady, surely to thee above all womankind the\n",
      "Olympians have given a heart that cannot be softened. No\n",
      "other woman in the world would harden her heart to stand\n",
      "thus aloof from her husband, who after much travail and\n",
      "sore had come to her, in the twentieth year, to his own\n",
      "country. Nay come, nurse, strew a bed for me to lie all\n",
      "alone, for assuredly her spirit within her is as iron.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then wise Penelope answered him again: 'Strange man, I have\n",
      "no proud thoughts nor do I think scorn of thee, nor am I\n",
      "too greatly astonied, but I know right well what manner of\n",
      "man thou wert, when thou wentest forth out of Ithaca, on\n",
      "the long-oared galley. But come, Eurycleia, spread for him\n",
      "the good bedstead outside the stablished bridal chamber\n",
      "that he built himself. Thither bring ye forth the good\n",
      "bedstead and cast bedding thereon, even fleeces and rugs\n",
      "and shining blankets.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So she spake and made trial of her lord, but Odysseus in\n",
      "sore displeasure spake to his true wife, saying: 'Verily a\n",
      "bitter word is this, lady, that thou hast spoken. Who has\n",
      "set my bed otherwhere? Hard it would be for one, how\n",
      "skilled so ever, unless a god were to come that might\n",
      "easily set it in another place, if so he would. But of men\n",
      "there is none living, howsoever strong in his youth, that\n",
      "could lightly upheave it, for a great token is wrought in\n",
      "the fashioning of the bed, and it was I that made it and\n",
      "none other. There was growing a bush of olive, long of\n",
      "leaf, and most goodly of growth, within the inner court,\n",
      "and the stem as large as a pillar. Round about this I built\n",
      "the chamber, till I had finished it, with stones close set,\n",
      "and I roofed it over well and added thereto compacted doors\n",
      "fitting well. Next I sheared off all the light wood of the\n",
      "long-leaved olive, and rough-hewed the trunk upwards from\n",
      "the root, and smoothed it around with the adze, well and\n",
      "skilfully, and made straight the line thereto and so\n",
      "fashioned it into the bedpost, and I bored it all with the\n",
      "auger. Beginning from this bedpost, I wrought at the\n",
      "bedstead till I had finished it, and made it fair with\n",
      "inlaid work of gold and of silver and of ivory. Then I made\n",
      "fast therein a bright purple band of oxhide. Even so I\n",
      "declare to thee this token, and I know not, lady, if the\n",
      "bedstead be yet fast in his place, or if some man has cut\n",
      "away the stem of the olive tree, and set the bedstead\n",
      "otherwhere.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and at once her knees were loosened, and her\n",
      "heart melted within her, as she knew the sure tokens that\n",
      "Odysseus showed her. Then she fell a weeping, and ran\n",
      "straight toward him and cast her hands about his neck, and\n",
      "kissed his head and spake, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Be not angry with me, Odysseus, for thou wert ever at\n",
      "other times the wisest of men. It is the gods that gave us\n",
      "sorrow, the gods who begrudged us that we should abide\n",
      "together and have joy of our youth, and come to the\n",
      "threshold of old age. So now be not wroth with me hereat\n",
      "nor full of indignation, because at the first, when I saw\n",
      "thee, I did not welcome thee straightway. For always my\n",
      "heart within my breast shuddered, for fear lest some man\n",
      "should come and deceive me with his words, for many they be\n",
      "that devise gainful schemes and evil. Nay even Argive\n",
      "Helen, daughter of Zeus, would not have lain with a\n",
      "stranger, and taken him for a lover, had she known that the\n",
      "warlike sons of the Achaeans would bring her home again to\n",
      "her own dear country. Howsoever, it was the god that set\n",
      "her upon this shameful deed; nor ever, ere that, did she\n",
      "lay up in her heart the thought of this folly, a bitter\n",
      "folly, whence on us too first came sorrow. But now that\n",
      "thou hast told all the sure tokens of our bed, which never\n",
      "was seen by mortal man, save by thee and me and one maiden\n",
      "only, the daughter of Actor, that my father gave me ere yet\n",

      "ungentle as it is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus she spake, and in his heart she stirred yet a greater\n",
      "longing to lament, and he wept as he embraced his beloved\n",
      "wife and true. And even as when the sight of land is\n",
      "welcome to swimmers, whose well-wrought ship Poseidon hath\n",
      "smitten on the deep, all driven with the wind and swelling\n",
      "waves, and but a remnant hath escaped the grey sea-water\n",
      "and swum to the shore, and their bodies are all crusted\n",
      "with the brine, and gladly have they set foot on land and\n",
      "escaped an evil end; so welcome to her was the sight of her\n",
      "lord, and her white arms she would never quite let go from\n",
      "his neck. And now would the rosy-fingered Dawn have risen\n",
      "upon their weeping, but the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, had\n",
      "other thoughts. The night she held long in the utmost West,\n",
      "and on the other side she stayed the golden-throned Dawn by\n",
      "the stream Oceanus, and suffered her not to harness the\n",
      "swift-footed steeds that bear light to men, Lampus and\n",
      "Phaethon, the steeds ever young, that bring the morning.\n",

      "wife, saying: 'Lady, we have not yet come to the issue of\n",
      "all our labours; but still there will be toil unmeasured,\n",
      "long and difficult, that I must needs bring to a full end.\n",
      "Even so the spirit of Teiresias foretold to me, on that day\n",
      "when I went down into the house of Hades, to inquire after\n",
      "a returning for myself and my company. Wherefore come,\n",
      "lady, let us to bed, that forthwith we may take our joy of\n",
      "rest beneath the spell of sweet sleep.'\n",

      "Then wise Penelope answered him: 'Thy bed verily shall be\n",

      "and thine own country. But now that thou hast noted it and\n",
      "the god has put it into thy heart, come, tell me of this\n",
      "ordeal, for methinks the day will come when I must learn\n",
      "it, and timely knowledge is no hurt.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And Odysseus of many counsels answered her saying: 'Ah, why\n",

      "tell thee all and hide nought. Howbeit thy heart shall have\n",
      "no joy of it, as even I myself have no pleasure therein.\n",
      "For Teiresias bade me fare to many cities of men, carrying\n",
      "a shapen oar in my hands, till I should come to such men as\n",

      "have they knowledge of ships of purple cheek nor of shapen\n",
      "oars, which serve for wings to ships. And he told me this\n",
      "with manifest token, which I will not hide from thee. In\n",
      "the day when another wayfarer should meet me and say that I\n",
      "had a winnowing fan on my stout shoulder, even then he bade\n",

      "clothed in a filthy doublet, patched and unseemly, with\n",
      "clouted leggings of oxhide bound about his legs, against\n",
      "the scratches of the thorns, and long sleeves over his\n",
      "hands by reason of the brambles, and on his head he wore a\n",
      "goatskin cap, and so he nursed his sorrow. Now when the\n",
      "steadfast goodly Odysseus saw his father thus wasted with\n",
      "age and in great grief of heart, he stood still beneath a\n",
      "tall pear tree and let fall a tear. Then he communed with\n",
      "his heart and soul, whether he should fall on his father's\n",
      "neck and kiss him, and tell him all, how he had returned\n",
      "and come to his own country, or whether he should first\n",
      "question him and prove him in every word. And as he thought\n",
      "within himself, this seemed to him the better way, namely,\n",
      "first to prove his father and speak to him sharply. So with\n",
      "this intent the goodly Odysseus went up to him. Now he was\n",
      "holding his head down and kept digging about the plant,\n",
      "while his renowned son stood by him and spake, saying:\n",

      "olive, or pear, or garden-bed in all the close, that is not\n",

      "surely know, if it be indeed to Ithaca that I am now come,\n",
      "as one yonder told me who met with me but now on the way\n",
      "hither. He was but of little understanding, for he deigned\n",
      "not to tell me all nor to heed my saying, when I questioned\n",
      "him concerning my friend, whether indeed he is yet alive or\n",
      "is even now dead and within the house of Hades. For I will\n",
      "declare it and do thou mark and listen: once did I kindly\n",
      "entreat a man in mine own dear country, who came to our\n",
      "home, and never yet has any mortal been dearer of all the\n",
      "strangers that have drawn to my house from afar. He\n",
      "declared him to be by lineage from out of Ithaca, and said\n",
      "that his own father was Laertes son of Arceisius. So I led\n",
      "him to our halls and gave him good entertainment, with all\n",
      "loving-kindness, out of the plenty that was within. Such\n",
      "gifts too I gave him as are the due of guests; of well\n",
      "wrought gold I gave him seven talents, and a mixing bowl of\n",
      "flowered work, all of silver, and twelve cloaks of single\n",
      "fold, and as many coverlets, and as many goodly mantles and\n",
      "doublets to boot, and besides all these, four women skilled\n",

      "thy countless gifts, thou didst bestow in vain. For if thou\n",

      "devoured in the deep sea, or on the shore he has fallen the\n",

      "sorrow. With both his hands he clutched the dust and ashes\n",
      "and showered them on his gray head, with ceaseless\n",
      "groaning. Then the heart of Odysseus was moved, and up\n",
      "through his nostrils throbbed anon the keen sting of sorrow\n",

      "and I was begging of thee this and that, being but a little\n",
      "child, and following thee through the garden. Through these\n",
      "very trees we were going, and thou didst tell me the names\n",
      "of each of them. Pear-trees thirteen thou gavest me and ten\n",
      "apple-trees and figs two-score, and, as we went, thou didst\n",
      "name the fifty rows of vines thou wouldest give me, whereof\n",

      "So he spake, and straightway his knees were loosened, and\n",
      "his heart melted within him, as he knew the sure tokens\n",
      "that Odysseus showed him. About his dear son he cast his\n",
      "arms, and the steadfast goodly Odysseus caught him fainting\n",

      "speedily as may be.'\n",
      "\n",
      "After these words the twain set out to the goodly halls.\n",
      "Now when they had come to the fair-lying house, they found\n",

      "flesh, and mixing the dark wine. Meanwhile the Sicilian\n",
      "handmaid bathed high-hearted Laertes in his house, and\n",
      "anointed him with olive-oil, and cast a fair mantle about\n",
      "him. Then Athene drew nigh, and made greater the limbs of\n",
      "the shepherd of the people, taller she made him than before\n",
      "and mightier to behold. Then he went forth from the bath,\n",
      "and his dear son marvelled at him, beholding him like to\n",

      "the continent, being then the prince of the Cephallenians,\n",
      "would that in such might, and with mail about my shoulders,\n",
      "I had stood to aid thee yesterday in our house, and to beat\n",
      "back the wooers; so should I have loosened the knees of\n",
      "many an one of them in the halls, and thou shouldest have\n",
      "been gladdened in thine inmost heart!'\n",
      "\n",
      "So they spake each with the other. But when the others had\n",
      "ceased from their task and made ready the feast, they sat\n",
      "down all orderly on chairs and on high seats. Then they\n",
      "began to put forth their hands on the meat, and the old man\n",
      "Dolius drew nigh, and the old man's sons withal came tired\n",
      "from their labour in the fields, for their mother, the aged\n",
      "Sicilian woman, had gone forth and called them, she that\n",
      "saw to their living and diligently cared for the old man,\n",
      "now that old age had laid hold on him. So soon as they\n",
      "looked on Odysseus and took knowledge of him, they stood\n",
      "still in the halls in great amazement. But Odysseus\n",
      "addressed them in gentle words, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Old man, sit down to meat and do ye forget your\n",
      "marvelling, for long have we been eager to put forth our\n",
      "hands on the food, as we abode in the hall alway expecting\n",
      "your coming.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and Dolius ran straight toward him stretching\n",
      "forth both his hands, and he grasped the hand of Odysseus\n",
      "and kissed it on the wrist, and uttering his voice spake to\n",
      "him winged words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Beloved, forasmuch as thou hast come back to us who sore\n",
      "desired thee, and no longer thought to see thee, and the\n",
      "gods have led thee home again;--hail to thee and welcome\n",
      "manifold, and may the gods give thee all good fortune!\n",
      "Moreover tell me this truly, that I may be assured, whether\n",
      "wise Penelope yet knows well that thou hast come back\n",
      "hither, or whether we shall dispatch a messenger.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Odysseus of many counsels answered saying: 'Old man,\n",
      "already she knows all; what need to busy thyself herewith?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereon the other sat him down again on his polished\n",
      "settle. And in like wise the sons of Dolius gathered about\n",
      "the renowned Odysseus, and greeted him well and clasped his\n",
      "hands, and then sat down all orderly by Dolius their\n",
      "father.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they were busy with the meal in the halls. Now Rumour\n",
      "the messenger went swiftly all about the city, telling the\n",
      "tale of the dire death and fate of the wooers. And the\n",
      "people heard it, and all at once gathered together from\n",
      "every side with sighing and groaning before the house of\n",
      "Odysseus. And each brought forth his dead from the halls,\n",
      "and buried them; but those that came out of other cities\n",
      "they placed on swift ships and sent with fisherfolk, each\n",
      "to be carried to his own home. As for them they all fared\n",
      "together to the assembly-place, in sorrow of heart. When\n",
      "they were all gathered and come together, Eupeithes arose\n",
      "and spake among them, for a comfortless grief lay heavy on\n",
      "his heart for his son Antinous, the first man that goodly\n",
      "Odysseus had slain. Weeping for him he made harangue and\n",
      "spake among them:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Friends, a great deed truly hath this man devised against\n",
      "the Achaeans. Some with his ships he led away, many men,\n",
      "and noble, and his hollow ships hath he lost, and utterly\n",
      "lost of his company, and others again, and those far the\n",
      "best of the Cephallenians he hath slain on his coming home.\n",
      "Up now, before ever he gets him swiftly either to Pylos or\n",
      "to fair Elis, where the Epeians bear sway, let us go forth;\n",
      "else even hereafter shall we have shame of face for ever.\n",
      "For a scorn this is even for the ears of men unborn to\n",
      "hear, if we avenge not ourselves on the slayers of our sons\n",
      "and of our brethren. Life would no more be sweet to me, but\n",
      "rather would I die straightway and be with the departed.\n",
      "Up, let us be going, lest these fellows be beforehand with\n",
      "us and get them over the sea.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he spake weeping, and pity fell on all the Achaeans.\n",
      "Then came near to them Medon and the divine minstrel, forth\n",
      "from the halls of Odysseus, for that sleep had let them go.\n",
      "They stood in the midst of the gathering, and amazement\n",
      "seized every man. Then Medon, wise of heart, spake among\n",
      "them, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, for surely Odysseus\n",
      "planned not these deeds without the will of the gods. Nay I\n",
      "myself beheld a god immortal, who stood hard by Odysseus,\n",
      "in the perfect semblance of Mentor; now as a deathless god\n",
      "was he manifest in front of Odysseus, cheering him, and yet\n",
      "again scaring the wooers he stormed through the hall, and\n",
      "they fell thick one on another.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he spake, and pale fear gat hold of the limbs of all.\n",
      "Then the old man, the lord Halitherses, spake among them,\n",
      "the son of Mastor, for he alone saw before and after. Out\n",
      "of his good will be made harangue and spake among them,\n",
      "saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hearken to me now, ye men of Ithaca, to the word that I\n",
      "will say. Through your own cowardice, my friends, have\n",
      "these deeds come to pass. For ye obeyed not me, nor Mentor,\n",
      "the shepherd of the people, to make your sons cease from\n",
      "their foolish ways. A great villainy they wrought in their\n",
      "evil infatuation, wasting the wealth and holding in no\n",
      "regard the wife of a prince, while they deemed that he\n",
      "would never more come home. And now let things be on this\n",
      "wise, and obey my counsel. Let us not go forth against him,\n",
      "lest haply some may find a bane of their own bringing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, but they leapt up with a great cry, the more\n",
      "part of them, while the rest abode there together; for his\n",
      "counsel was not to the mind of the more part, but they gave\n",
      "ear to Eupeithes, and swiftly thereafter they rushed for\n",
      "their armour. So when they had arrayed them in shining\n",
      "mail, they assembled together in front of the spacious\n",
      "town. And Eupeithes led them in his witlessness, for he\n",
      "thought to avenge the slaying of his son, yet himself was\n",
      "never to return, but then and there to meet his doom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Athene spake to Zeus, the son of Cronos, saying: 'O\n",
      "Father, our father Cronides, throned in the highest, answer\n",
      "and tell me what is now the hidden counsel of thy heart?\n",
      "Wilt thou yet further rouse up evil war and the terrible\n",
      "din of battle, or art thou minded to set them at one again\n",
      "in friendship?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Zeus, the gatherer of the clouds, answered her saying:\n",
      "'My child, why dost thou thus straitly question me, and ask\n",
      "me this? Nay didst not thou thyself devise this very\n",
      "thought, namely, that Odysseus should indeed take vengeance\n",
      "on these men at his coming? Do as thou wilt, but I will\n",
      "tell thee of the better way. Now that goodly Odysseus hath\n",
      "wreaked vengeance on the wooers, let them make a firm\n",
      "covenant together with sacrifice, and let him be king all\n",
      "his days, and let us bring about oblivion of the slaying of\n",
      "their children and their brethren; so may both sides love\n",
      "one another as of old, and let peace and wealth abundant be\n",
      "their portion.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Therewith he roused Athene to yet greater eagerness, and\n",
      "from the peaks of Olympus she came glancing down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when they had put from them the desire of honey-sweet\n",
      "food, the steadfast goodly Odysseus began to speak among\n",
      "them, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Let one go forth and see, lest the people be already\n",
      "drawing near against us.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So he spake, and the son of Dolius went forth at his\n",
      "bidding, and stood on the outer threshold and saw them all\n",
      "close at hand. Then straightway he spake to Odysseus winged\n",
      "words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Here they be, close upon us! Quick, let us to arms!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereon they rose up and arrayed them in their harness,\n",
      "Odysseus and his men being four, and the six sons of\n",
      "Dolius, and likewise Laertes and Dolius did on their\n",
      "armour, grey-headed as they were, warriors through stress\n",
      "of need. Now when they had clad them in shining mail, they\n",
      "opened the gates and went forth and Odysseus led them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Athene, daughter of Zeus, drew near them in the\n",
      "likeness of Mentor, in fashion and in voice. And the\n",
      "steadfast goodly Odysseus beheld her and was glad, and\n",
      "straightway he spake to Telemachus his dear son:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Telemachus, soon shalt thou learn this, when thou thyself\n",
      "art got to the place of the battle where the best men try\n",
      "the issue,--namely, not to bring shame on thy father's\n",
      "house, on us who in time past have been eminent for might\n",
      "and hardihood over all the world.'\n",
      "\n",

      "disgracing thy line, according to thy word.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So spake he, and Laertes was glad and spake, saying: 'What\n",
      "a day has dawned for me, kind gods; yea, a glad man am I!\n",
      "My son and my son's son are vying with one another in\n",
      "valour.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then grey-eyed Athene stood beside Laertes, and spake to\n",
      "him: 'O son of Arceisius that art far the dearest of all my\n",

      "straightway swung his long spear aloft and hurled it, and\n",
      "smote Eupeithes through his casque with the cheek-piece of\n",
      "bronze. The armour kept not out the spear that went clean\n",
      "through, and he fell with a crash, and his arms rattled\n",
