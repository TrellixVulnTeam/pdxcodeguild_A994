# Travel With Friends

Thank you for taking the time to review this new code.

This is an attempt at creating a web application (mobile device option); an interactive platform that will allow users to connect annonymously with other users while traveling, in the hopes of meeting new people and experiencing new places.

If you would like to contribute to this code, I'm making this application open source, free to the public.

### Product Overview

The web application allows users to check their geo-location, surrounding landmarks, businesses, and events on their phone. Allowing the user to check-into a Journey or Trip that others have in the past or present, providing feedback and advice about the Journey. Users can also anonymously communicate with others users inside the app to ask questions and give further advice in real time. 

### Specific Functionality

Users can create, view, edit Profile, create or view Journey, create or view Events, send messages to other users, give feedback and rate other Users advice about Journey or Events.

Current Scope of Work:
* Landing Page
* User Account Creation
* Login with OAuth

Here is a mockup using [draw.io](https://draw.io/) showing some basic ideas.


### Data Model

What are the persistent "nouns" you need to save across pages in your project MVP?
What do they represent?

We'll be using a relational database which models things like a spreadsheet.
There are fixed fields and every instance

How do you need to _search_ for specific instances of nouns?

### Technical Components

What are the "moving parts" of your MVP?
What are the things like "modules" you're going to write?
How do they talk to each other?

_Make decisions_ here and now.
Do research and prototyping to figure out what libraries and technologies will help you solve your problems.
Write up which ones you'll use.
It's okay if they end up not working and you have to change your plans.

This is _more specific_ than "Django backend, CSS style, etc."
Please specify what specific technical problems you'll have to solve and a guess at the solution.

### Schedule

Write out the order in which you will tackle your technical components of your MVP.

What are the easy parts?
What are the hard parts?
Can you guess how long you'll take for each?

Work on the tough and crucial parts first.

### Further Work

All of the above parts are _just addressing your MVP_.
Here you should outline other features you'd like to implement if you get "done" early.
Order them by importance towards your high-level goal and what order you'll work on them later.

Don't work on any of these features until **all of MVP is complete**.

## Submission

Create a _new_ git repo based on your project name [in GitHub](https://github.com/new).
Init that repository with a readme.
Write up your proposal as `proposal.md` and link to it from the readme.
I don't care that you learn all of the fancy parts of [writing Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/), but just get some basic sections that follow the rubric above.

Email me the URL to your capstone repo on GitHub before the proposal is due.
