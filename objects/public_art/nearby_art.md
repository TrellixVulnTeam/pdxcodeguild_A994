# Portland Public Art module

Write a module that takes a users location and displays the geographically nearest public art details.  Support text search functionality.  

Here is the dataset description from the source:

```A weekly updated CSV file containing permanently sited works of public art, sourced from the Regional Arts & Culture Council. This searchable database provides information and images of more than 1800 publicly owned artwork in the City and County.```

The dataset is availible [here](http://www.civicapps.org/datasets/public-art) but I have also places it in this directory as `public_art.csv`
