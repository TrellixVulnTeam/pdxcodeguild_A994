# High-Level Process

My goal is to structure the class as much like a developer job as possible. To that end, below is a high-level overview of how a typical week will flow.

- Monday
	- Morning:
		- Assign pair programming partner
		- Discuss learning objectives for the week (technical & interpersonal)
		- Go over assignments for the week
	- Afternoon:
		- Instruction on technical concepts
- Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
	- Mornings:
		- Instruction on technical concepts
	- Afternoons:
		- Work on assignments in pairs, as individuals, or as a group.
- Friday
	- Morning:
		- Retrospective/demos
	- Afternoon:
		- 20-30 minute 1-on-1

Additionally, when possible, Iâ€™ll bring in external speakers to talk about topics of interest.
