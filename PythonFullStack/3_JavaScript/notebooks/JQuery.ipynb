    "# jQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) was first published in 2006 by [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/). Around [74% of the 1M most popular websites](https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery) use jQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "jQuery was written at a time when web browsers were very inconsistent and buggy in their implementations of then nascent standards. Resig wrote the library with two goals in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To simplify working with the DOM\n",
    "1. To reduce the number of cross-browser issues that would need to be addressed when developing web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "jQuery quickly grew to do much more including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use CSS selectors to select elements (this was before `querySelector` existed!)\n",
    "- Provide a consistent interface for setting and reacting to events\n",
    "- Provide a consistent interface for making Ajax calls and handling their responses\n",
    "- Set arbitrary CSS on elements\n",
    "- Measure the dimensions of elements on the page (harder than you might think!)\n",
    "- Animate elements on the page\n",
    "\n",
    "When he wrote jQuery, Resig did two things that were pretty brilliant for 2006 and contributed to its rapid adoption:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Leveraged chaining to simplify working with DOM elements\n",
    "1. Provided a plugin API so people could extend jQuery with isolated pieces of code (there are some [seriously cool plugins](http://www.creativebloq.com/jquery/top-jquery-plugins-6133175) out there)\n",
    "\n",
    "The jQuery project also published [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/), one of the first and most complete mobile JavaScript frameworks, and [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/), a robust set of UI widgets you can use in your pages.\n",
    "\n",
