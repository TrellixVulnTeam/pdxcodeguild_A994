    "Use the built-in function `prompt` to ask the user for input. The result of `prompt` should be assigned to a variable.\n",

    "Similar to the `index` method on Python lists, JavaScript arrays have a method called [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) that returns the array index of the value or `-1` if the value is not present.\n",
