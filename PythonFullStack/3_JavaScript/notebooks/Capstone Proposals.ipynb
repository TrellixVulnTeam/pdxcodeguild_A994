    "# Capstone Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "Write up a **proposal** for your [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) capstone project idea. It should be as brief as possible (but no briefer!) and clear. Feel free to hand draw mockups and include them if that helps you plan, but they canâ€™t take the place of a write-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Einstein quote](http://vireomd.net/blog/dhc/images/einstein-everything-simple.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your proposal serves a few important purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Front-load decision making. Figure out _now_ how you're going to solve your problems. Do some prototyping and research.\n",
    "1. Guidance _for you._ When you're working on the project, you can look at it and know what to do next.\n",
    "1. Sanity check that it meets the requirements below. I am _not_ evaluating the business savvy of your project (although I'd be happy to give my two cents, if you ask).\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Include all of the sections listed below\n",
    "* Write your proposal in Markdown and posted to your `capstone` repo as `PROPOSAL.md`\n",
    "* Describe a MVP that meets the capstone requirements\n",
    "* Describe a project that you can finish on time\n",
    "* Keep your proposal up-to-date as your project expands or evolves\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capstone Proposal Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "Please address all of the following areas in your proposal **for just your MVP.** Even if you have grand dreams for working on your capstone full-time, _only_ write up the MVP here.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Product Name\n",
    "1. Product Overview\n",
    "1. Specific Functionality\n",
    "1. Data Model\n",
    "1. Technical Components\n",
    "1. Estimated Schedule\n",
    "1. Functionality Beyond Your MVP\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product Name\n",
    "\n",
    "Give your product or project a simple, short name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "What is your MVP web app going to do? How does a user interact with it on a high level?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Spend some time drawing out on paper mockups _every_ page of your MVP site. Annotate _every_ component of the interface _every_ action the user can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is any actions your app needs to take in the background describe _each_ of them and how they change the underlying data your app saves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pick the minimum feature set for your product to work.** Everything else should go in the â€œfurther workâ€ section.\n",
    "\n",
    "You donâ€™t have to submit the mockup drawings, but do write out a description of _every_ page and component and action.\n",
    "I literally mean _every._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the nouns you need to save across pages in your project MVP? What do they represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a relational database which models things like a spreadsheet. There are fixed fields and every instance\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you need to _search_ for specific instances of nouns?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Components\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the moving parts of your MVP? What are the things like \"modules\" you're going to write? How do they talk to each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Make decisions_ here and now. Do research and prototyping to figure out what libraries and technologies will help you solve your problems. Write up which ones you'll use. Itâ€™s okay if they end up not working and you have to change your plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is _more specific_ than Django backend, CSS styles, etc.â€ Please specify what specific technical problems youâ€™ll have to solve and a guess at the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wireframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) and [flowcharts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart) are appropriate artifacts to include in your proposal. Developing those will help you think through the details of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are good tools for helping you plan your projects. The following are just examples. Look around for tools that suit how you work (and post them to Slack!)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)\n",
    "- [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "Write out the order in which you will tackle your technical components of your MVP.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the easy parts? What are the hard parts? Can you guess how long youâ€™ll take for each?\n",
    "\n",
    "Work on the tough and crucial parts first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Work\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above parts are _just addressing your MVP._ Here you should outline other features you'd like to implement if you get done early. Order them by importance towards your high-level goal and what order youâ€™ll work on them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't work on any of these features until **all of MVP is complete.**\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposals should be written in Markdown. The [syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) is pretty simple to master.\n"
