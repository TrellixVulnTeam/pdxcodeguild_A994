Suppose the heights of stacked hutches are [1,4,2,5,1,2,3] (the hutches are shown below):

...X...
.X.X...
.X.X..X
.XXX.XX
XXXXXXX
1425123

When water is poured over the top at all places and allowed to runoff, it will remain trapped at the 'O' locations:

...X...
.XOX...
.XOXOOX
.XXXOXX
XXXXXXX
1425123

The amount of water that has accumulated is the number of Os, which, in this instance, is 5.

>>> answer([1, 4, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3])
5
>>> answer([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])
0
