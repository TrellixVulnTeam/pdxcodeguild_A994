# Django (Ice Cream Poll)
Write a django application that serves a site with three pages:

1. A Poll submission
1. Submission acknowledgement
1. Summary

### Lab Overview
- On the poll submission page ask people what their favorite flavor of ice cream is:

- On the summary page, have a table of flavors and percentages.

- If a flavor has never been voted for, give it a 0%.

- Solicit people in the code guild to fill out your poll by using `./manage.py runserver <IPADDR>:PORT`

`Note: your app does not have to use ice cream.`
